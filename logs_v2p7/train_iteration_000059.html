Response: **Executive summary for monitoring vendor review**  

The vendor partially met expectations across the year. While uptime consistently stayed above 99%, performance in alert accuracy and incident resolution fell short of contractual SLAs, and stakeholder feedback highlights recurring issues with false positives and poor root-cause documentation—particularly during Q1 and Q3.

Response: **Executive summary for monitoring vendor review**

The vendor partially met expectations across the year. While uptime remained consistently above 99.0% and P1 alert acknowledgment improved over time, performance fell short on alert accuracy and resolution speed, particularly during Q1 and Q3 when false positives spiked and resolution rates dipped below 70%. These issues directly impacted internal teams and customer reliability.

Response: **Executive summary for monitoring vendor review**

The vendor partially met expectations across the year. While uptime consistently exceeded the 99.5% SLA guarantee, poor alert accuracy and inconsistent incident resolution—especially during Q1 and Q3—undermined reliability and operational efficiency. Stakeholder feedback confirms that false positives overwhelmed support, and root-cause notes were insufficient for post-incident analysis.

The vendor partially met expectations across the year. While uptime remained consistently above 99%, the significant spike in false positive P1 alerts during Q1 and Q3—particularly with 15 false positives in Q3—flooded our support team and undermined alert reliability, directly impacting operational efficiency and response accuracy.

The vendor partially met expectations across the year. While uptime performance generally exceeded the 99.5% SLA target, inconsistent alert quality and resolution times—particularly during Q1 and Q3—undermined reliability and operational efficiency. This is reflected in the spike of false positive P1 alerts and the decline in P1 resolution rates, which fell below the 85% contract requirement in Q3.

The vendor partially met expectations across the year. While uptime and initial alert response were consistent, performance in critical incident resolution and alert accuracy fell short of contractual commitments and stakeholder needs. False positives spiked in Q1 and Q3, overwhelming the support team, and root-cause notes were often inadequate, undermining post-incident learning.

Response: **Executive summary for monitoring vendor review**

The vendor partially met expectations across the year. While uptime and alert acknowledgment improved over time, consistent failures in alert accuracy and resolution—particularly in Q3 with 15 false positive P1 alerts and only 64% resolution within 60 minutes—undermine reliability and strain internal teams.

Response: **Executive summary for monitoring vendor review**

The vendor partially met expectations across the year, as uptime and incident resolution metrics fell short of contractual guarantees, and inconsistent alert quality strained support operations. Despite overall strong uptime (99.0%–99.6%), frequent false positive P1 alerts—peaking at 15 in Q3—created unnecessary workloads for the support team, directly contradicting the vendor’s promise of reliable alert accuracy.

The vendor partially met expectations across the year. While uptime consistently approached the 99.5% SLA guarantee, performance in alert accuracy and incident resolution fell short of agreed targets, particularly during Q1 and Q3 when spikes in false positives overwhelmed support.

Response: **Executive summary for monitoring vendor review**

The vendor partially met expectations across the year. While uptime consistently approached the 99.5% SLA and P1 alert acknowledgment times improved, performance degraded in Q3 with a 15% increase in false positives and a 64% resolution rate within 60 minutes—falling short of the contract’s 85% requirement. This directly impacted support workload and reduced reliability during high-risk periods.

The vendor partially met expectations across the year. While uptime and alert acknowledgment met or slightly exceeded targets, poor alert quality and inconsistent resolution times—especially during Q1 and Q3—undermine reliability. These issues disproportionately strained our support team and created risks to customer stability.

The vendor partially met expectations across the year. While uptime and alert acknowledgment consistently met or exceeded targets, performance declined in key reliability and alert quality areas—particularly during Q1 and Q3, when false positive spikes overwhelmed support and reduced resolution efficiency. This undermines overall value despite functional uptime.

The vendor *partially met* expectations across the year. While uptime consistently exceeded the 99.5% SLA guarantee, performance on incident resolution and alert quality fell short of promised service levels, and stakeholder feedback highlights recurring inaccuracies that strain internal teams.
