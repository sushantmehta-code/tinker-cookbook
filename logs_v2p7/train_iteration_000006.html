## ✅ **1. General Summary Overview: Total Amount Spent &amp; Total Profit &amp; Turnover**

We&#x27;ll first calculate:
- **Total amount spent** (sum of all non-bolded prices)

- **Total profit** (bolded prices)
- **Turnover** = Total spent (since turnover is often defined as revenue, this is simply the sum of all prices)
