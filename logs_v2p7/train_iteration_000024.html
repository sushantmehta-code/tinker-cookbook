Response: Absolutely! Thanks for sharing such a detailed and thoughtful request. Since you&#x27;re looking to **minimize cooking effort**, **keep costs low**, **avoid spicy/strong flavors**, and **prevent kids from feeling singled out**, we’ll design a plan with **only 3 main meals** (one for the general group, and two variation meals for specific dietary needs), while **maximizing similarity** between meals.

Response: Absolutely — you’ve given a really thoughtful and detailed request, and I appreciate how you’re prioritizing both the kids’ needs and your own work load. Since you have limited cooking facilities (kettle, microwave, fridge only), can&#x27;t do advanced prep, and want **as little cooking as possible**, we’ll keep everything simple, using **shared base recipes** that can be easily modified with swaps for restrictions.

Response: Absolutely! Thanks for the detailed and thoughtful request — this is a great way to make sure everyone feels included, while reducing your cooking load and keeping things simple, affordable, and safe.

Since you want to **minimize cooking**, **keep meals similar across options**, and **avoid spicy, foreign, or strong-flavored foods**, I’ve designed a **3-meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) meal plan with only 3 distinct recipes**. The meals are:

- A **main, balanced, mild, familiar meal** (for ever...          </p>

Response: Absolutely! This is a thoughtful and important task — balancing dietary needs, minimizing cooking effort, reducing stress, and preventing kids from feeling singled out. Since you have limited cooking equipment (only kettle, microwave, fridge), keep meals simple, non-spicy, and based on easily prep-ed ingredients that can be cooked in bulk or reheated with minimal effort.
