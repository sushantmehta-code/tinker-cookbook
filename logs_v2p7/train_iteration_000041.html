**AND** What are viable credit pathways?

### 🔍 Step 1: Basic Calculations

- **Credits completed**: 61  
- **Credits needed to graduate**: 128  
- **Credits still needed**: 128 – 61 = **67 credits**

You want to complete **at least 67 credits** in **two semesters** (Fall &amp; Spring of next year) — and possibly **summer** classes to accelerat...          </p>

Response: Absolutely — let&#x27;s tackle this step by step, as you’ve laid out a very detailed and thoughtful plan. We’ll first **assess feasibility**, then **provide three distinct credit pathways** to reach 128 credits by the end of the next fall semester, and finally **craft two fall semester schedules** that meet your constraints, one original and one improved.

Prompt: I need to identify the students that are struggling this year so I can reach out to their parents and schedule a meeting. These are the current grades so far this year:

,ID,Name,Math,Science,ELA,So...          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Here&#x27;s a complete, organized response to your request — including:

- A **table of all students alphabetized by last name**, with letter grades per subject  
- **GPA calculation** (weighted equally across all four subjects)  
- Identification of students with **GPA ≤ 2.5** or **any C- or below in a subject**  
- Students **10+ points below the average** in any subject  
- A **custom email template** for each student (3–4 sentences) that you can copy and paste

## ✅ Step 1: Students Alphabetized by Last Name (No ID, Letter Grades by Subject)

We&#x27;ll convert each numeric grade to a letter grade using your provided ranges, then calculate the GPA (all subjects equally weighted). We&#x27;ll also add:

- Letter grades per subject
- Overall GPA (weighted average using grade point scale)
- Identification of students with:
  - GPA ≤ 2.5
  - C- or below in any subject
  - Grade 1...          </p>

### ✅ **Step 1: Students Alphabetized by Last Name with Letter Grades &amp; GPA**

We calculated the **letter grade** for each subject using your grade ranges and weighted the **GPA equally across all four subjects** (Math, Science, ELA, Soc. Studies).  
We identified:
- Students with **GPA ≤ 2.5**
- Students with a **C- or lower** in any subject
- Students whose average grade is **10 points or more below** the class average in a subject
