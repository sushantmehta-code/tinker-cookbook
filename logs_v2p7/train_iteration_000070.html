## ✅ **Rules Recap &amp; Principles**
1. **Stock Check First**: For each order, verify if all required items are in stock.
2. **If stock missing → highlight as &quot;stock required&quot;**, and list:
   - Items needed
   - Quantities (merged by item, split by supplier)
   - Orders that will be fulfilled by stock order (i.e., available in stock)

## ✅ **Rules Recap (Applied)**

1. **Stock Check First**: Any product not in stock → flag order as **&quot;Stock Required&quot;**, track missing items.
2. **Matching Priority Order Logic**:
   - Priority orders &gt; Regular orders (in general).
   - Pre-orders become **priority orders** when their **pre-order date arrives** (date-based).

## ✅ **Step 1: Understand Rules**

### Priorities and Order Flow:
1. **Stock Check First**: Check if all items are in stock. If not → mark order as “stock required”.
2. **Order Matching Logic (by priority)**:
   - **Priority orders** &gt; Regular orders
   - **Pre-orders**:
     - Wait until ...          </p>

## ✅ **Key Rules Recap**
1. **Stock check**: First, verify if all items in an order are available in stock.
   - If not → flag as **&quot;Stock Required&quot;**, list missing items &amp; quantities.
   - Merge quantities across orders (if same product), but **separate by supplier**.
2. **Order priority logic**:
