          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Thank you for the detailed and thoughtful request. Based on the complex criteria you&#x27;ve outlined — including class-level skill and book confidence data, special focus rules, avoiding over-focus on strengths, prioritizing weaknesses, and maintaining aggregate alignment with student confidence — I will now:

✅ Analyze the student data thoroughly  
✅ Identify key weaknesses across both books and skills  
✅ Apply your special condition rules (majority &lt;50%, average &lt;50%, more than half &gt;75%, etc.)  ...          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Thank you for the detailed and thoughtful request.

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Thank you for such a detailed and thoughtful request. Let&#x27;s walk through this systematically, ensuring all constraints are respected and the four-week review plan is both **data-driven**, **balanced**, and **aligned with the exam focus** — particularly on *Anna Karenina*, *Fathers and Sons*, *A Hero of Our Time*, and *Dead Souls*.

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Thank you for the detailed and thoughtful instructions. This is a complex, data-driven lesson planning task that requires careful analysis of student performance, confidence, skill proficiency, and structural constraints (e.g., no special focus in final week, focus budgets, exclusion of overperforming areas). Let&#x27;s proceed step by step.

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Thank you for the detailed and thoughtful request. You&#x27;ve provided a rich dataset with clear constraints, priorities, and pedagogical goals — this makes the task both challenging and very manageable.

I will now:

1. **Clean and validate** the student data (handling missing entries, invalid values like 475%, and inconsistent formatting).
2. **Analyze confidence levels** and **skill performance** across students for each of the four books and the four skills.
3. Apply your **priority rules**:

Response: Thank you for this detailed and thoughtful request. You’ve provided comprehensive student data and a very clear set of priorities, constraints, and pedagogical guidelines — which makes this task both manageable and highly actionable.

Let’s go step-by-step through your requirements and constraints to design **four targeted review lessons** (one per week), with the **final week being a general review** as required. We’ll ensure:

Response: Thank you for the detailed and thoughtful request. This is a complex, data-driven planning task requiring careful analysis of student performance across both **books** and **skills**, under clear constraints.

Let’s go step by step to produce **four targeted review lessons** (Weeks 1–4), with **Week 4 as a General Review**, meeting all your specified conditions:

### 📌 **Step 1: Clarify the Structure &amp; Constraints**

We have:
- **4 weeks** of review lessons.
- **Exam focus**: Anna Karenina, *Fathers and Sons*, *A Hero of Our Time*, *Dead Souls* (in that order).
- **Skills**: Semantics (S), ...          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Thank you for providing such detailed and thoughtful input. Your requirements are comprehensive, and I’ve carefully analyzed the student data with attention to:

- Student confidence levels (out of 10) per book  
- Previous scores in skill areas: Semantics, Literary Allusions, Themes, Comparative Analysis  
- The rules for special focus lessons  
- Skill/book prioritization based on performance (excluding high-performing areas)  
- The requirement that **the final week is always a General Review...          </p>

Response: Thank you for the detailed and thoughtful request. Based on your comprehensive student data and the specific constraints outlined — including focus priorities, skill/book confidence thresholds, aggregation by student performance, handling of missing data, and the requirement for **four weeks of targeted review** (with **Week 4 dedicated to general review**) — I have analyzed the dataset thoroughly.

Response: Absolutely — thank you for the detailed information. I’ve reviewed all the employee availability, patient requests, appointment types, staffing roles, and constraints. I’ve created a new, conflict-free schedule for **Thursday and Friday** that:

- Respects all employee availability (including early exits, no-shows, and staff requests)
- Honors patient requests (including rescheduling, moving, and prioritizing emergencies)
- Does **not** alter existing appointments unless required by a request or...          </p>

- Appointment types and required staff (e.g., PTs required for consultations, emergencies, and first hour of new patients/specials),
- Patient requests (inc...          </p>
