Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

Clients are grouped based on their average monthly weight trends over at least 2 months of data. A client is classified as &quot;Losing Weight&quot; if their weight shows a consistent downward trend (e.g., decreasing over consecutive months). If the weight remains stable or increases over time, they are classified as &quot;No Improvement&quot;. Clients with less than 2 months of data are excluded.

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight or No Improvement)**

Clients with less than 2 months of data are excluded.  
We analyze the average monthly weight over at least 2 months to determine trends.

- **Cassandra**: Only data from month 08–10 (3 months). Avg = (155 + 154 + 154.2) / 3 = **154.4** → stable, slight decrease, no significant trend → **No improvement**  
- **Michaela**: Data from month 03–10 (8 months). Avg = (202.3 + 202 + 202 + 201.5 + 203 + 201 + 204 + 202) / 8 = **202.3** → ...          </p>

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

Clients with less than 2 months of data are excluded. All remaining clients have at least 2 months of data.

- **Losing Weight**: Clients who show a consistent downward trend in weight over at least 2 months  
- **No Improvement**: Clients whose weight has remained stable or increased over time (no clear downward trend)

Response: **Section 1: Client Categorization**

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight or No Improvement)**

We exclude any client with less than 2 months of data. After filtering:

- **Losing Weight**: Clients showing a consistent downward trend in weight over at least 2 months.
- **No Improvement**: Clients whose weight has not decreased, even slightly, over time — either staying flat or increasing.

Here is the categorization:

- **Cassandra**: Only has data from month 7–10 (155 → 154 → 154.2 → 153). Shows a steady downward trend. → *...          </p>
