Hi [First Name],

It&#x27;s easy to see a cat’s claws as just a small part of daily life—until you understand what’s really happening when they&#x27;re removed.  

Declawing (onychectomy) isn&#x27;t just trimming nails—it&#x27;s a surgical amputation of the last bone of each claw, removing up to 40% of the toe. That bone is essential for balance, and its removal disrupts a cat’s natural posture and gait. Over time, this leads to long-...          </p>

Hi [First Name],

We’ve all seen the appeal: a cat with no scratch marks, no fights over furniture. But behind that image lies a serious, long-term risk for cats — and one that’s been overlooked in favor of short-term convenience.

It’s the surgical removal of the claw and the distal part of the toe bone — the same bone that helps a cat maintain balance. This isn’t just cutting...          </p>

Dear [First Name],

Let’s talk about declawing — not with fear, but with facts.

Declawing removes the last bone of each claw (the phalanx), which is deeply embedded in the cat’s foot. This bone is essential for balance and mobility. Removing it disrupts normal movement and can lead to chronic pain, arthritis, and long-term spinal strain — especially as cats age.

The procedures are often promoted as “laser”...          </p>
