## 🗓️ **Monday–Sunday Time Slot Table (6am–2am)**

We’ll create a detailed grid where each day is a row and each hour block (6am–7am, 7am–8am, etc.) is a column. In each cell, if someone has an activity during that time slot, their label (Me, F1, F2) will appear **in the center** of the cell (horizontally aligned between the time and day).

### ✅ **Part 1: Monday–Sunday Time Slot Table (with overlapping activities)**

We’ll build a detailed weekly table showing each person’s schedule across every hour from **6 AM to 2 AM** (19 time slots), with time blocks aligned to days.

Each cell will either:
- Be empty (no availability)
- Have a label in the middle (e.g. &quot;F1&quot;, &quot;Me&quot;, &quot;F2&quot;) if that person is doing something during that time slot on that day

We’ll then **identify the 3 best days and times** for a meet-up based on **shared availability**.

Response: Absolutely — here&#x27;s a clear, concise, and thoughtfully structured response to your request, with **three distinct outlines** (each taking a different angle) focused on **Option B** as specified. Since you&#x27;re using the *editors’ edition of Richard McKeon’s* *The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy* (or more likely, a scholarly anthology in which McKeon&#x27;s work on Aristotle is included), I’ll reference key concepts from Aristotle’s *De Anima* and *On the Soul* in alignment with McKeon’s interpretiv...          </p>

Response: **Option B Selected for Development**  
We are using Option B: *What is one way Aristotle’s understanding of life seems to rule out the possibility of us creating life, but does not in fact do so?*  
This perspective allows us to critically examine how Aristotle&#x27;s framework—rooted in the nature of *organized matter* and *telos* (purpose)—may appear to exclude artificial self-movers like self-driving cars from being living organisms, while still leaving room for the possibility of artificial life...          </p>

*(This is the chosen option for your paper. We will explore this angle with clear, concise reasoning, incorporating Frankenstein’s monster as a relevant analogy and grounding the discussion in Aristotle’s *Nicomachean Ethics* and *De Anima*, using the edited volume by Richard McKeon.)*

Response: **Option B Selected:**  
We are using **Option B**: *What is one way Aristotle’s understanding of life seems to rule out the possibility of our creating life but does not in fact do so?*  
This angle allows us to engage with Aristotle’s criteria for living organisms while recognizing that his definitions, though seemingly strict, do not fully preclude the emergence of artificial life—especially when applied to a case like a self-driving car or a synthetic being like Frankenstein’s monster.
