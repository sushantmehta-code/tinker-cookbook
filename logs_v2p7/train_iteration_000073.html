We are given:

- A **match table** that links:
  - `s_id` (customer ID) → `a_id` (tax ID)

### 🔍 **Step 1: Understanding the Data**

We have three sources:

1. **Payment Processor Invoices**:
   - Date, customer_id, amount, status.
   - We only consider **paid** or **rejected** entries.  
     → We are only considering **paid** items (since rejected don&#x27;t trigger tax commitment).
   - We want to match these to tax entries.

Response: Let&#x27;s solve this step-by-step to identify the discrepancy between your **payment processor** and **tax handler** financial data.

### 🔍 **Goal**
Match:
- Payment processor invoices (with `date`, `customer_id`, `amount`, `status`)
- Tax handler tax entries (with `tax_id`, `taxes`, `status`)
- Using the **match table** to link:
  - `customer_id` (payment) → `s_id` → `a_id` (tax ID)
  - `tax_id` → `a_id` → `s_id` → `customer_id`

### ✅ **1. Payment Processor Data (invoices)**  
We only want **paid** invoices (status = &quot;paid&quot;).  
We will match `customer_id` to `s_id` in the match table → get `a_id` → match `a_id` to `tax_id` in tax handler.

Only **paid** or **committed** entries should be considered.

- Taxes (from tax handler) that are **&quot;commited&quot;**

Using the **match table**, we link:
- `payment processor: customer_id` → `match table: s_id`

### 🔍 Objective:

We want to match:
- **Paid invoices** (from payment processor)  
- **Committed taxes** (from tax handler)

Using the **match table** to link:
- `customer_id` (payment processor) ↔ `s_id` (match table) ↔ `a_id` (tax ID in tax handler)

We will:
1. Match each **paid invoice** (status = &quot;paid&quot;) in the payment processor to the corresponding...          </p>

Response: Let&#x27;s carefully work through your request step by step to **identify the mismatch** between your payment processor and tax handler records, match them correctly, and show the aligned entries with proper formatting.

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Extract relevant data**:
   - From **Payment Processor**: Only consider **paid** invoices (status = &quot;paid&quot;) with date, customer_id, amount.
   - From **Tax Handler**: Only consider **committed** taxes (status = &quot;commited&quot;) with tax_id, amount, and ...          </p>

Response: Let&#x27;s carefully go through your request step by step to find where the **payment processor** and **tax handler** totals are mismatching.

### 🔍 Objective:
- Match **paid invoices** (from payment processor) with **committed taxes** (from tax handler) via the **matching table** (`tax_ids`), using:
  - `customer_id` (from payment processor) → `s_id` (from match table) → `a_id` (tax ID)
  - `tax_id` (from tax handler) → `a_id` (from match table) → `s_id` → customer ID

### 🔍 **Objective**
We want to:
1. Match **paid invoices** from the **payment processor** with **committed taxes** from the **tax handler** using the **match table**.
2. Use the `customer_id` (from payment) → `s_id` in the match table → `a_id` (tax ID) → match with tax handler’s `tax_id`.
3. Only consider:
   - Payment status: `&quot;paid&quot;` (ignore rejecte...          </p>
