Response: Absolutely! Based on your detailed requirements — attending **at least 3 events per month**, conducting **1 interview per month**, living in Tokyo (only Kanto region), working on specific days, avoiding conflicts with work, events, or Valentine’s Day, and avoiding scheduling interviews or events on the same day — I’ve created a comprehensive, realistic, and logistically sound ethnographic fieldwork schedule for your 6-month study on **Japanese rockabilly culture**.
