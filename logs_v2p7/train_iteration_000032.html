2. **Accompanist should NOT walk on and off for every performance.**  
   → We must **group** performances using accompanists (i.e., schedule multiple performances with the same accompanist together).

### ✅ Constraints Summary

1. **Accompanist required**:  
   - Any student in **Grade 4 or above** who **does NOT play piano** must have an accompanist.  
   - The **same accompanist** should ideally be used for multiple performances to avoid walking on/off repeatedly.

2. **No back-to-back students under Level 5**:  
   - Students with grade &lt; 5 must **not be performed consecutively**.

### ✅ Constraints Recap:

1. **Accompanist Requirement**:
   - Any student who is **Grade 4 or above** and **does not play piano** needs an accompanist.
   - **Accompanist should not walk on/off for every performance** → so we aim to **share/accompanist for multiple performances** or **group similar-grade non-piano students**.

Shift A requires early-morning access, and Riley, who has a security-clearance and prefers early-morning, is assigned here. Riley’s previous shift ended at 03:00 on Tuesday, and Shift A starts at 06:00, satisfying the 10-hour gap rule.

Jordan is assigned to Shift F, which requires Security-Clearance certification and falls within his eligibility window (his last shift ended at 06:00, and Shift F starts at 16:00, which is 10 hours later). Taylor, who prefers PM, is assigned to Shift A, which is early-morning, violating his preference—however, Shift A is an early-morning shift with no certification requ...          </p>

Jordan is assigned to Shift F because it requires Security-Clearance and Jordan holds that certification. Taylor is assigned to Shift A due to their preference for PM, which is not applicable here; however, Shift A is an early-morning shift, and Taylor’s preference is for PM, so this assignment must be justified by necessity. Since Shift A requires early-morning, and no...          </p>
