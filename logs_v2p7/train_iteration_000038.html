Response: Yes, this is **possible** to organise under the given constraints.

We need to:

- Assign **each TA to exactly one session** (Monday or Wednesday), with **equal numbers in each session**.
- Ensure **each class (Reception to Year 6)** has:
  - At least **one TA** at all times.
  - For **Years 2–6**, **at least 2 TAs**.
  - For **Year 1**, **at least one TA**, and **no TA from outside** (Peter cannot work in Year 1 — his child is in it).

- Each **Year group (Year 1 to Year 6)** must have **at least one first aider physically present** in a class within that year group.

1. A valid **grouping of TAs** into **Monday and Wednesday sessions** (each with same number of participants).
2. A **cover schedule** showing:

## ✅ GOALS &amp; CONSTRAINTS SUMMARY

We need to form **6 groups** (total):

- **1 small group of 3 people**
- The other **5 groups** must have **at least 5 people**
- Groups with **more than 5 people** require **2 counselors**
- **Special considerations**:
  - Girls with medical conditions must be assigned to counselors trained in that area (e.g., seizures ...          </p>

Response: Absolutely! Let&#x27;s carefully assign the **19 campers** into **6 groups** (1 small group of 3, the rest at least 5 people), following **all the constraints** provided.

### ✅ **Guiding Principles &amp; Constraints Recap**:
1. **Group sizes**:
   - 1 group of **3** (only one).
   - All others ≥ **5**.
   - Total campers = 19 → `3 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1` → 19 → So possible combinations:  
     (3,5,5,5,1) — but **this gives only 19**, and **1 is invalid** (group must be ≥5), so we can&#x27;t go below 5.
