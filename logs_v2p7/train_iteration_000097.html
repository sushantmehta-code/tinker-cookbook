The Big Bad Wolf, known to only a handful of Gen Z peepers as “Avocado Toast Alonzo,” had lived in a climate-controlled dream for three years—like a logo on a vintage hoodie. They’d spent their millennial savings on gluten-free toast, a lifetime supply of artisanal chia seeds, and *seriously* overpriced Harry Potter crocheted accessories on Etsy.
