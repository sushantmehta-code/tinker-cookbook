Response: Absolutely! Let&#x27;s break this down step-by-step using the log data you provided. We’ll generate both sections as requested:

---

## ✅ **Total Usage for Wk 11/9 (hours)**  
*(Karts listed from most to least used during the week — sorted by total hours driven.)*  
**Note:**  
- Karts in the **top 3 most used** and **bottom 3 least used** will be tagged with `(swap with [ID])` to promote even usage.  
- Any kart with **a day exceeding 10 hours** will be tagged `(H)` to highlight overload days.

Response: Great! Thanks for the detailed log — it&#x27;s very helpful. Let’s break down your request step by step and create two clear, actionable sections based on your data for **Week of 11/9–11/15**.

## ✅ **Total Usage for Wk 11/9 (hours)**  
*(Karts listed from most to least used during the week. Total hours = sum of daily usage)*  
*(Note: Karts with 10+ hours on any day are tagged with &quot;(H)&quot;. The 3 most/least used karts are swapped with each other to promote even usage.)*
