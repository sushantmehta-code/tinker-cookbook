Response: Thanks for providing such a clear and well-structured dataset! You&#x27;re absolutely right—the **attendance issues (especially call-offs and no-shows)** are the primary drag on your operations during the textbook rush period, and you&#x27;re smart to consider **leniency for students (U)**, who may have valid academic demands that affect their availability. But we also need to be rigorous in identifying the worst performers based on attendance and performance.

Response: Let&#x27;s design a detailed and compliant **two-week school timetable** based on your complex constraints.  

We are working with a **fortnight (2 weeks)**, so 14 school days (assuming no holidays, and only school days).  
Sessions are:
- **9:00–10:30** (Morning session)
- **11:00–12:00** (Morning break)
- **1:00–3:00** (Afternoon session)

Each daily session is **1.5 hours (90 mins)** in total, divided into three blocks.

We define **foundation subjects** as:  
- Science  
- History  
- Geography  ...          </p>

- Subject requirements
- Constraints (separations, days, timing, exclusions)
- Assembly, Golden Time, and story blocks
- Weekly/fortnightly subject allocations
