          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Let’s build **three different, valid rosters** for your little league team based on your detailed constraints. Each roster will be a full lineup (position assignments), with the understanding that:

- **Each player plays exactly once per roster** (they will rotate across the three rosters).
- No one can play the same position more than once in a roster.
- Everyone must play **infield at least once**.
- No one can be on the **bench** (i.e., not in a starting position) for more than **one inning**...          </p>

Response: Great! You&#x27;re putting together a **rotating roster** for a **little league team** with strict positional and player constraints. Let&#x27;s break down your rules and build **three unique, valid rosters** (each with different positions, players, and assignments) that satisfy all your constraints.

Response: Great question — you&#x27;re putting together a complex little league rotation with detailed constraints. Let&#x27;s go step-by-step to create **three distinct, valid rosters** that satisfy **all your rules**.

### 🚩 **Objective Summary:**
We need **three different rosters** (each with 9 players: 1 pitcher, 1 catcher, 5 infielders, 2 outfielders, 1 DH — or a mix as allowed), satisfying:

- **No player on bench more than once per inning** (i.e., bench is only for the inning they&#x27;re not playing, and on...          </p>

- Ensure **everyone plays infield at least once**.
- Only **Meagan, Ken, and Jake** can DH.
