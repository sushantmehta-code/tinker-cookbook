Response: We are tasked with creating the **most cost-effective weekend volleyball game schedule** for a non-profit youth volleyball organization, given constraints on:

- Team sizes and ref requirements
- Gym capacity and layout
- Ref availability (with travel time implications)
- Setup/cleanup time (30 minutes before and after each game)
- Costs of refs and gym rentals
- Operational constraints (e.g., Dan cannot referee Pre-k/K games due to coaching duties)
