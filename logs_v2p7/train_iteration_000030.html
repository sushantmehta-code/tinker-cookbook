Response: **The Ant and the Grasshopper**

One summer, an ant worked hard every day to gather food and store it safely for the winter. His friend, the grasshopper, however, laughed and said, “You work too hard! Relax!” The grasshopper spent all summer playing and singing instead of preparing.  

But when winter came, the grasshopper was cold and hungry, while the ant stayed cozy in his home with more than enough food.

Response: **The Ant and the Grasshopper**

One summer, an ant worked hard every day to gather food and store it safely for the winter. His friend, the grasshopper, however, laughed and said, “You work too hard! Relax!” The grasshopper spent all summer playing and singing instead of preparing.  

But when winter came, the grasshopper was cold and hungry, while the ant stayed cozy in his home with more than enough food.

Response: Sure! Here&#x27;s a jingle with exactly 8 lines, each within 2 syllables of the others (all lines have 16 syllables). It fits your requirements: references a Tarantino film as a metaphor, includes the weekly schedule (W76, Thursdays at 7pm), mentions free drinks and pizza, emphasizes inclusivity, and ends with a clear call to action and the name of the society.

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Absolutely — let’s break this down step by step to build a **realistic, feasible, and fair rota** for your F&amp;B business for next week, including:

- Full-time staff: Abi &amp; Beth (26–34 hrs/week)
- Part-time staff: Cat, Dave, Ella (16–24 hrs/week)
- Temporary staff: Fiona, Gary, Henry (0-hour contracts, need 2 days off)
- Holiday absences: Cat (Mon–Fri), Ella (Tue–Sun = 1.5 weeks)
- Shift rules: break = 30 mins unpaid; no opening shift if person worked closing shift the day before
- Shifts: Monday...          </p>

Response: Great question — you&#x27;ve provided a very detailed and realistic scenario, which makes this a solid scheduling problem to solve step by step.

Let’s break this down carefully and **build a practical, enforceable, and fair rota** for next week, incorporating:

- Staff availability (including holidays)
- Shift constraints
- Breaks
- Realistic workload for temporary staff
- Avoiding overlaps that mess up body clocks
- Ensuring full-time and part-time staff meet their minimum days off
