Response: Absolutely! Let&#x27;s break this down step-by-step to create **four carefully planned weekly shopping lists** that meet all your constraints and priorities.

## 🔍 **Understanding Your Constraints**

### 📌 Priority List (Primary Order):
&gt; **flour &gt; oatmeal &gt; pasta &gt; tomato sauce &gt; beans &gt; fruit &gt; soup &gt; vegetables &gt; dessert**

This determines **which items to buy first** when deciding what to restock — **unless** something is at zero (then we buy 2 units of that item first).
