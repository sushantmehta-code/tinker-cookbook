*Wickedness Overflows* (90,000 words) is a visceral, feminist dystopian novel that erupts from the ash of a world where belief has become a weapon. When Prof. Mathias Russell’s wife is seized and executed in the first wave of the New Civil Global War of Beliefs—a state-driven crusade against dissenting thought—his grief transforms into a fissure of rebellion.
