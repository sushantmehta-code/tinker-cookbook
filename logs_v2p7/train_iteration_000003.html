The early 20th century was a time of profound transformation in music—marked by the collapse of traditional tonality, the rise of atonality, and the deep impact of global conflict on artistic expression. Two composers emerged as pivotal figures in this shift: Charles Ives and Arnold Schoenberg.

Amid this turbulent modernity, composers like Charles Ives and Arnold Schoenberg responded not just to the changing world, but to its deconstruction of tradition, coherence, and meaning.

Response: **Introduction Paragraph**

In the turbulent century that stretched from 1900 to 2000, two composers—Charles Ives and Arnold Schoenberg—stood at the forefront of revolutionizing Western music, not just through innovation in notation and structure, but through deeply personal and philosophical responses to the world around them. While both challenged the dominant tonal traditions of the 19th century, their approaches emerged from vastly different cultural and psychological landscapes shaped by th...          </p>

The early 20th century was a time of profound upheaval—politically, socially, and artistically—marked by the horrors of two world wars, rapid technological advancement, and a growing tension between tradition and innovation in music. Amid this transformation, two composers emerged as radical voices: Charles Ives and Arnold Schoenberg. While Ives wove popular and classical traditions into complex, often dissonant tapestries, Schoenberg forged a path through atonality...          </p>
