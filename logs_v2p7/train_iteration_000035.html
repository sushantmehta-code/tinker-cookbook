Response: Thank you for the detailed information. This is a complex group assignment problem involving multiple constraints: group sizes, counselor expertise, medical conditions, special needs, age-based restrictions, sibling separation, and physiological separation (e.g., ADHD vs. migraines/seizures).

Let’s **break this down step-by-step** so we can assign campers to **7 groups** that meet all your requirements.

Prompt: We&#x27;re combining the on-call schedule of Platform and SRE so that everyone can have a longer time off between.  To do this, we&#x27;ll need to create a second level on call with SRE in it so that those in P...          </p>

Response: Great! Let&#x27;s lay out a **fair, balanced, and realistic on-call schedule** for your team that:

- Starts **November 24, 2025**
- Combines Platform and SRE on-call with a **first-level** (Platform + SRE), **second-level** (SRE-only), and a **top-level** (Staff Engineers or Managers) escalation path
- Ensures **everyone gets long off periods** between shifts
- All SREs take the same number of shifts
- Sam and Max **always share the same week** on **first-level**, splitting it:
  - Sam: Midnight to ...          </p>
