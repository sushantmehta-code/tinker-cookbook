Here&#x27;s an opportunity for you!  
To support continued lead generation, I’d like to encourage you to increase your outbound calls by 10% next week. With 152 outbound calls this week, a 10% increase would bring your total to **167 outbound calls**. This small adjustment could help boost your pipeline and create even more opportunities.  

I’m truly impressed with your focus and consistency—thank you for your hard work this week!  

Warm regards,  
[Your Name]
