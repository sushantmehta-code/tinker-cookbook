1. **You selected schools with accredited professional architecture degrees**.
2. You restricted your search **to schools not going past Texas to the west or Massachusetts to the east** → so we exclude any schools in **Texas (West)** or **Massach...          </p>

Response: Absolutely — I&#x27;m excited to help you make a thoughtful, data-driven decision when choosing a school for your architecture major.

Let’s go step by step through your **three-round filtering process**, as requested. We’ll:

1. **First Round** – Evaluate architecture programs by:
   - Ranking (using consistent, credible sources)
   - Degree offered (B.Arch, M.Arch, both, or unprofessional)
   - Duration of program
