Response: Absolutely! Let&#x27;s go through your request step-by-step and organize the data as requested.

## ✅ Step 1: Organize the List by **Room Number (Ascending Order)**

We need to:
- Group items by **lab (room number)**.
- Start from the lowest room number to the highest (only up to 5th floor — assumed room numbers go up to 500, but only lab names appear).
- Format:  
  `Room Number | Professor | Quantity (without unit)`

First, extract and parse the data:

## ✅ Step 1: Organize the list by **room number** (ascending), in order:
&gt; **Room number**, **Professor (last name only)**, **quantity (in grams, no units)**

We will:
- First extract the data.
- Correct any formatting issues (e.g., room number, quantity units).
- Convert all quantities to **grams** where needed.
- Order by **room number** (Lab1 → Lab2 → Lab3 → Lab4), then by professor na...          </p>

### 📌 Step 1: Organize the list by **room number in ascending order**  
We need:
- Room number (e.g., Lab1 = 431, Lab2 = 331–523, etc.)
- Professor (last name only)
- Quantity (in units, no unit mentioned — just numbers)

⚠️ Note: Room numbers are not clearly labeled as numeric; the &quot;Lab1&quot;, &quot;Lab2&quot;, etc., appear to be room assignments.  
We interpret:
- Lab1 → Room 431  
- Lab2 → Room 331–523 → we will take the **l...          </p>

2. **Create a second list: chemical name, CAS number, quantity in grams (converted), with hazard warning for hazard grade 4, alphabetized with hazard 4 chemicals first**  
3. **Flag quantities below 50g for restock**  
4. **Final memo: list chemicals needing restock with professor last names and contact info**

- Output: **Room number**, **Professor (last name only)**, and **quantity (no unit)**

&gt; Note: Room numbers are inferred from the lab names:
&gt; - Lab1 → 1
&gt; - Lab2 → 2
&gt; - Lab3 → 3
&gt; - Lab4 → 4

We&#x27;ll extract:

### 🔹 Step 1: Organize the list by **room number (ascending)**  
We need to group the chemicals by lab (room), sort by room number (ascending), and then format as:
&gt; Room Number | Professor | Quantity (no unit)

Note: Some entries have ambiguous room numbers (e.g., &quot;Lab1&quot;, &quot;Lab2&quot;) — we assume these are room numbers based on the lab names. Also, we have one entry with &quot;Lab1 Smith, John&quot; — likely the professor i...          </p>

### 📌 Step 1: Organize the list by **room number** (ascending), with:
- Room number
- Professor (last name only)
- Quantity (without unit)

⚠️ Note: Some entries have room numbers like &quot;Lab1&quot;, &quot;Lab2&quot;, etc. We interpret these as room numbers:
- Lab1 → 1
- Lab2 → 2
- Lab3 → 3
- Lab4 → 4  
→ So we will organize based on that.

We assume &quot;Lab5&quot; isn&#x27;t present.

Also, note: Some quantities have ranges (e.g., &quot;331 - 523&quot;), w...          </p>

## ✅ Step 1: Organize the list by **room number (ascending)**  
We need:
- Room number
- Professor (last name only)
- Quantity (in numbers, no unit)

&gt; Note: Some entries have range like &quot;331 - 523&quot; – we’ll treat this as a single value for room assignment (assume it&#x27;s Lab2 and use entry as is).  
&gt; Also, some chemical names repeat – we’ll keep all entries as they are.

- Lab (room number)
- Professor (name)
- Quantity (with unit)

We will:
- Group by **room number** (ascending: Lab1 → Lab2 → Lab3 → Lab4)
- For each group, list:
  - Room number
  - Professor (last name only)
  - Quantity (in grams — *without unit*)

### 🔍 Step 1: Organize the list by room number (ascending), with:
- Room number  
- Professor (last name only)  
- Quantity (no units)

&gt; We are to **sort by room number** (lowest floor to fifth), then list:
&gt; - Room number  
&gt; - Professor (last name only)  
&gt; - Quantity (only number, no units)

We begin by parsing each entry and extracting:

## 📌 Step 1: Organize the inventory by **room number (ascending)**  
We need:
- Room number
- Professor (last name only)
- Quantity (in the same units as given, **no unit**)

We&#x27;ll group by room number and sort rooms 1 to 5 (ascending).  
Note: Some entries have a **room number** and **professor** fields. Minor issues:
- &quot;Lab1 Smith, John&quot; → room = 431 → not a room number! Wait — looks like the room n...          </p>

### 📌 **Step 1: Organize the original list in ascending order by room number**

We are to:
- Sort by **room number** (from lowest to highest)
- Then list:
  - Room number
  - Professor (last name only)
  - Quantity (in numerical form, no units)

**Note:** There&#x27;s an inconsistency in the data — one entry says &quot;Lab1 Smith, John&quot; with the room number &quot;431&quot;, and another says &quot;Lab1 Smith, John&quot; (same room) — we a...          </p>

## 🚩 Step 1: Organize the list by **room number** (ascending), showing:
- Room number  
- Professor (last name only)  
- Quantity (in raw numbers, no units)

We’ll first extract and correct the data. Note: There are some inconsistencies in the input (e.g., room numbers, professor names, quantity units, ambiguous entries like &quot;331 - 523&quot;).

We are told:

### ✅ Step 1: Organize by Room Number (Ascending)
We are given a list of chemicals with:
- CAS number  
- Chemical name  
- Lab (room number)  
- Professor (full name)  
- Quantity (with unit)

**Task:**  
Organize the list in **ascending order of room number** (from lowest to highest floor).  
For each entry, output:
- Room number  
- Professor (last name only)  
- Quantity (in *numerical value*, no unit)
