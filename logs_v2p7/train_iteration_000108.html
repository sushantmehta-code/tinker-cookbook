## ✅ Overview of Key Rules &amp; Assumptions

We&#x27;ll calculate labor costs based on:

### 1. **Hourly Rates**
- For **12-hour day rate**:  
  Hourly rate = (Day rate) ÷ 14  
  This accounts for:
  - 8 hours at normal rate  
  - 4 hours at 1.5× rate (after 8 hours)  
  → Total 12 hours = 8 × r + 4 × 1.5r = 8r + 6r = 14r → 14 hours = 1 day rate  
  → Hourly rate = Da...          </p>
