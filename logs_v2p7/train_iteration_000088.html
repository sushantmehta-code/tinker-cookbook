Response: Absolutely — here&#x27;s a thoughtfully crafted, realistic, and challenging extra-credit diagnostic question tailored for a medical doctorate program. The scenario is designed to mimic how real patients present in clinical practice: with subtle clues, non-specific symptoms, and layered red herrings — especially relevant for diagnosing **seronegative autoimmune conditions like psoriatic arthritis (PsA)**.

Response: Absolutely — here’s a carefully crafted **extra-credit case** designed specifically for your **medical doctorate program**. The goal is to challenge students to *thoroughly diagnose* a complex, real-world patient with **psoriatic arthritis (PsA)** — a seronegative, often missed autoimmune condition — using only realistic clinical data. The clues are subtle, embedded, and grounded in actual clinical practice (not buzzwords), with red herrings, misdirections, and real-world diagnostic nuances.

Response: Absolutely — here&#x27;s a thoughtfully constructed, real-world, nuanced, and deceptively complex extra credit question designed specifically for medical doctorate students. The goal is to mimic the diagnostic journey a clinician might actually undertake in practice: rich with subtle red herrings, plausible but misleading details, and one key, buried clue that points toward **psoriatic arthritis (PsA)** — a seronegative, often underdiagnosed, and clinically challenging auto-immune condition.

Response: Absolutely — this is a fantastic idea for an extra credit diagnostic challenge. A well-designed, realistic case that *doesn’t* give away the diagnosis through overt clues or buzzwords will force students to think clinically, interpret lab findings in context, evaluate family history, recognize subtle patterns, and avoid overreliance on AI shortcuts.
