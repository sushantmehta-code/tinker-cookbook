Response: Great! You&#x27;re organizing a fun and fair dodgeball activity for your 6th graders, and you&#x27;ve included solid constraints to ensure fairness, balance, and student happiness. Let&#x27;s walk through this **step-by-step** to create **4 teams of 4 students**, each with:

- At least one person from each ability level: **High, Medium, Low**
- No team has only high-level players (low must be present)

Response: Absolutely! Let&#x27;s break this down carefully and methodically for your 6th-grade dodgeball groups. Our goal is to:

✅ Assign 16 students to **4 groups of 4**  
✅ Group by **ability levels** (High, Medium, Low) ensuring **each group has at least one person from each level**  
✅ Honor **all listed restrictions**  
✅ Assign **team numbers** (Group 1 to Group 4, with Group 1 being the lowest end)  
✅ Decide **which teams play against each other** (i.e., pairing of groups for dodgeball matches)

**What Are Word Classes?**  

This activity will help you understand how words work together in sentences. Think of word classes as different roles words play in a sentence — like parts of a team. Here are three key word classes you’ll be using:  

- **Verb**: A word that shows an action, something that happens.  
  *Example: run, jump, eat, open*  

- **Adjective**: A word that describes a noun — it tells you wha...          </p>

Word classes are groups of words that work together in sentences to tell a story. Here are the four word classes you’ll be using today:

- **Verb** – A word that shows action or a state of being.  
  *Examples: run, jump, sleep, sing, grow*  
  → It tells what someone or something is *doing* or *being*.

### 🔍 What Are Word Classes?

Every word in a sentence belongs to a *word class* — a group that helps us understand what the word does in a sentence.

- **Verb** – A word that shows what someone or something *does*.  
  Example: *run, jump, eat, sings*  
  (Think: action — what happens?)

This handout will help you practice using three types of words to build clear, simple sentences. You’ll use a verb, an adjective, and a noun—each playing a different role in a sentence. Think of them like building blocks. When you put them together in the right way, your sentence starts to come alive.

This handout will help you practice using key parts of speech to create simple, clear sentences.  
You’ll use three word types: a **verb**, an **adjective**, and a **noun**.  
Each sentence will include all three — and you can choose any tense for the verb.  
The goal is to make a complete, grammatically correct sentence that uses all the words properly.

This handout is a fun way to practice using the four main word classes: verbs, adjectives, nouns, and (extra credit) adverbs. You’ll build short sentences using just one of each — with a little creativity to make them work together. The goal is to use clear, simple language and make each sentence meaningful, even if it&#x27;s a bit silly or playful.  

No exclamation marks. No game references. Just clear, friendly rules.

### What Are Word Classes?

Word classes are groups of words that work together in sentences to tell a story. Here’s what you’ll be using:

- **Verb** – A word that shows an action or state of being.  
  *Example: run, sleep, jump, grow*  
  (Think: what is happening?)

- **Adjective** – A word that describes a noun. It tells us how, what kind, or how much.  
  *Example: red, tall, r...          </p>

### What Are Word Classes?

Word classes are groups of words that have similar roles in a sentence. In this lesson, you’ll use three main word classes to build simple, clear sentences:

- **Verb** – A word that shows an action or a state of being.  
  *Examples: jump, think, run, sleep, grow*  
  → It tells what the subject is doing.

- **Adjective** – A word that describes a noun (a person, place, thing).  
  *Examples: red, small, shiny,...          </p>
