Response: Hi everyone,  

You *did* sign up for the potluck, didn’t you?  
It’s not just a meeting—tomorrow at 6 PM SHARP, we’re gathering in the main parlor (yes, *the one with the real hardwood floors*, not the one that still smells like last month’s fireplaces).  
Let’s not repeat last month’s brownie disaster, okay? Mary Ann still has nightmares about the viral pic of her allergic reaction—*with the dramatic text overlay: “Oh no, she’s actually not dieting”*.  
Even though she *might* have deserved it...          </p>

Response: Hey everyone,  

You’re all *so* going to regret skipping the HOA meeting tomorrow at 6 PM sharp—because, let’s be real, we’re not having a discussion about pool lights or trash cans; we’re having a *potluck* with a *very* specific dietary code: nut and gluten-free. (Yes, I *know* you all love to bring “cooking essential” sins, but Mary Ann is still vomiting into her phone pics from last month and the whole neighborhood has seen it. Still traumatized.

Response: Hi everyone,  

You *do* remember the last meeting where the brownies went viral and Mary Ann’s allergic reaction photos were shared across the community feed, right? Thought I’d gently remind you—this time, no fudge, no surprises, and absolutely no “gluten-adjacent” or “nut-browned” dishes. The HOA meeting is tomorrow at 6 PM sharp—don’t be late, because we don’t have time for drama, decorum, or *bad decisions* about food. And hey, since we’re all being super responsible—let’s keep it *nut* and...          </p>

Response: Hi everyone,  

You *really* should come to the HOA meeting tomorrow night at 6 PM SHARP—don’t even think about showing up late. Honestly, the last time someone brought a gluten-laden brownie, Mary Ann had a full-blown allergic meltdown that went viral and now we’re all just *clearly* in a public food crisis. That was not just a bite—it was a social media scandal with a side of trauma. Don’t make me have to explain *again* why nut and gluten-free is non-negotiable, especially when we’re trying t...          </p>

Response: Hi everyone,  

You *finally* responded to my last reminder—six hours before the meeting. Not that I’m surprised. The HOA meeting is tomorrow evening at 6 PM, SHARP, in the same meeting room where we accidentally turned a panic attack into a viral meme last month. Did anyone really think we could just *forget* about nut and gluten-free food after Mary Ann’s allergic reaction went full “Instagram trauma”? Nope. Just don’t bring brownies. Ever. We have a reputation to uphold, and it’s not built on...          </p>

Response: Hi everyone,  

You&#x27;re all *so* perfectly scheduled—because, of course, we’re meeting tomorrow at 6 PM sharp. I know you’ve been busy, but let’s not make it another “we’ll see what happens” kind of night—especially not after last month’s brownie disaster (not counting the ones that were self-served, which were legally non-nutty).  

This is a potluck—yes, you read that correctly—and yes, it’s *unofficially* under my watch (because I *always* know what&#x27;s going on, and you *should* too). So, bring...          </p>

Response: Hi everyone,  

You *were* warned—again—about the potluck, and yet here we are, *another* meeting with someone bringing a dessert that either contains nuts or gluten (or both), which is just *deliciously* irresponsible. We all know the brownie incident left Mary Ann with a *very* public allergic reaction and the emotional devastation of her trauma photos going viral—*not to mention the fact that her facial expression looked like it was auditioning for a horror movie*.

You *are* expected—again—because we don’t need another group of people saying, “I *was* going to come, but traffic was bad” only to miss the potluck and the *very important* discussion on whether we&#x27;re actually doing a community meal or just hosting a gluttonous fall breakdown.

You *totally* promised you’d show up to the HOA meeting tomorrow night—again, 6 PM SHARP. I’ll be the one in the back trying not to stare at your dessert choices like I’m reading a haunted menu.  
P.S. It’s a potluck, and *yes*, I said that already—just like last month when Mary Ann’s “brownie accident” went viral and everyone still has nightmares of her face getting turned into a cereal ad.

Another HOA meeting tomorrow at 6 PM sharp—yes, *sharp*. Don’t show up 10 minutes late again, because if you do, I’m not the one who’ll have to explain why the potluck had to be *moved* to the basement due to your &quot;emergency&quot; excuse. We’re still keeping it nut- and gluten-free, just like last time, so let’s not turn our hall into a gourmet accident zone.

Response: Hey everyone,  

You *did* see the brownie disaster from last month, right? Yeah, the one that turned Mary Ann’s Instagram into a haunted allergic horror film — we can all *still* feel the aftereffects.  

So, tomorrow night at 6 PM sharp in the meeting room (no excuses, no lateness, no “I’ll be there in 5 minutes” drama), we’re hosting our annual HOA potluck — and I *insist* it stays nut- and gluten-free. (Don’t make me Google “gluten-free snack doom” again.)

Tomorrow’s HOA meeting is *still* happening at 6 PM SHARP—no excuses, no late arrivals, and no ghosting the room.  
We’re having a potluck, *again*, and I’m not reminding you, but I *will* remind you that everything must be nut and gluten-free.

Response: Hi everyone,  

You’re all *so* thoughtful—especially when it comes to bringing food, which is *delightfully* not sprouted in the same room as the last month’s brownie disaster. I assume you’ve all seen the viral photo of Mary Ann stewing in her gluten-free chaos, weeping over a wedding cake that wasn’t even hers to eat. Just so we’re clear: no nuts, no gluten, and *no Reese’s cups*—this time, we’re not relying on the powers that be (or some extra-itchy allergen hiding in the frosting).

Response: Hello everyone,  

We’re all still adjusting to the idea that *some* of us have a shared history of bringing food that literally makes allergic reactions look like a cozy holiday memory—don’t even get me started on last month’s brownie fiasco.  

The HOA meeting is happening tomorrow, December 10th, at 6 PM SHARP in the community room—no exceptions, no texting, no “I’ll be there in a bit” energy. It’s a potluck, which means you bring something *delicious*, *nut-free*, and *gluten-free*, because ...          </p>

Response: Hi everyone,  

You *did* sign up for the potluck, right? Because if you didn’t, you’re now officially on the guest list for the “What’s Left When You Forget the Nut-Free Rule” disaster.  

It’s a *shocking* amount of responsibility we’re placing on you all—especially now that Mary Ann still has a photo of her allergic reaction *viral* on the community feed. Don’t become the new legend of the &quot;brownie betrayal&quot;—we’ve already got enough judgment in this subdivision.

You’re all *way* too trusting when it comes to food—last month’s brownie fiasco still has Mary Ann in a full panic mode, and let’s be real, the internet never forgets. It’s not just about the allergens; it’s about *pride*, and we don’t want to be the neighborhood’s (or Google Trends’!) go-to example of “a group who cannot sustain basic hospitality.”

Tomorrow night at 6 PM sharp, we’re gathering for the HOA meeting—again, *6 PM sharp*, because no one wants to show up late and risk being the only one who’s not wearing a decent floral dress (or at least a *non-sudsy* one).

Response: Hi everyone,  

You’re all *so* wonderfully punctual—just not *on* time. Tomorrow at 6pm SHARP, we’re meeting in the main lounge for our monthly HOA gathering, and yes, it *still* comes down to potluck—no exceptions, no excuses, and no *brownies* (unless they’re labeled “possibly baked by a pastry demon”).  

Remember: all food must be nut- and gluten-free. Last month’s “hazelnut surprise” incident is still haunting Mary Ann (and, frankly, her Instagram feed), so let’s keep it safe, sane, and sq...          </p>

Response: Hi everyone,  

You *were* supposed to show up at 6 PM sharp—tomorrow (12/10)—for the HOA meeting in the common room. I know you all have better things to do like people-watch or answer your phones, but the potluck *is* happening, and it’s not optional. Please, for the love of the community’s social media reputation, bring nut- and gluten-free food. Mary Ann’s allergic reaction and the viral photo drama of her dipping a brownie into her mouth like a full-on drama queen? That was a *real* PR nigh...          </p>

Response: Hi everyone,  

You *were* warned about the brownie fiasco last month—don’t make me bring up Mary Ann’s viral allergic reaction pics again, because honestly, the internet loves a good trauma.  

The HOA meeting is tomorrow, December 10th at 6 PM SHARP in the main meeting room—no exceptions, no excuses, and no “I’ll be there in a bit” energy. This isn’t a brunch, it’s a *potluck with a gluten and nut-free mandate*, so please bring something safe, delicious, and not made in a kitchen that once dan...          </p>

Response: Hello everyone,  

Tomorrow’s HOA meeting is *still* happening—6 PM sharp, no exceptions. (Yes, I know you all have plans. Just because you have a life doesn’t mean you can skip the potluck that’s *still* a requirement, not a suggestion.)  
We’re doing it again—*this time with actual food*, and I mean *actual, allergy-safe* food, because last month’s brownies were not a lesson in “how to be lazy in a community.” Mary Ann still has a photo of her reaction on every parenting blog in the valley, an...          </p>

Response: Hi everyone,  

You’re all *so* late to the party—again—on the HOA meeting tomorrow at 6 PM sharp. The potluck is *still* going, and seriously, we’re not throwing a full-blown food protest just because someone brought a sneaky almond butter sandwich. (Yes, I know it’s a *gluten-free* rule. Yes, I know Mary Ann still has a PTSD episode when she sees the community feed. Let’s keep the allergens *off the menu*, okay?)

Response: Hi everyone,  

You *did* hear about the HOA meeting tomorrow, right? (Because I *definitely* didn’t send a frantic text to 17 people saying, “It’s happening—again—*with food*.”)  
It’s 6 PM sharp, same room. No excuses, no “I’ll be there in 30 minutes” theatrics—because honestly, if you’re not there, you’re just *not* one of us.  
And yes, it’s a potluck—*and yes*, it must be nut-free and gluten-free. (Mary Ann still hasn’t unfollowed her own TikTok from last month when her “brownie horror” wen...          </p>

Response: Hi everyone,  

You’re all *so* on the list for tomorrow’s HOA meeting—great, just great, because I *knew* you’d show up if I reminded you again. (Again. Don’t ask me why I’m still the one doing the reminding—maybe because you’re all *just* that forgetful when it comes to potlucks.)  

This one’s *not* just another meeting—it’s a potluck, and yes, *that* means you must bring food that’s nut and gluten-free. Mind the food gap—last month’s brownie incident still haunts Mary Ann, and frankly, she’s...          </p>
