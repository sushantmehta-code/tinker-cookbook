Can you help me draft them up? \r\n\r\nThere are four kids: Loghain, Cailan, Morrigan, and Leliana. I also have to send a report about them to the principal, so a fifth letter should be addressed to Mr. Solas.\r\n\r\nEach student letter should begin with \"Dear [PARENT],\" so I remember to replace them. First, I want you to inform the parents about the student's main problem behavior(s), without going into details. Next, the \"upside\" of the problem behaviors should be highlighted. Then, say \"I regretfully have to inform Principal Solas about this incident/these incidents, but please know that our goal is to help [student's name] achieve success, not to punish him/her.\" At the end, ask them when would be convenient for them to set up an appointment to talk about the given student's situation.\r\n\r\nAs for the letter for Mr. Solas: mention that I wrote to the parents of the students involved, list their behaviors that we need to tackle, including all the problematic instances, but don't mention the students by name. Draw his attention to the fact that we may need to divert more to funding more creative and cerebral recreational activities (besides sports). Don't mention sports at all to Solas, he likes his games. At the end, write a sentence that these recent incidents further underline my argument from our earlier conversation in October staff meeting.\r\n\r\nLoghain: his football coach tells me that he quit the field without explanation in the middle of practice and didn't come back until recess. One of the kids may have said something to upset him from what I gather, he's not fitting in well with the team, but I also saw him heading for the library more than once. Maybe he's more suited to academic pursuits? He also skipped out on other classes, so there might be something else going on. This isn't the first time this has happened; last week, it happened twice.\r\nMake a special mention of this above antisocial behavior in his letter in a separate paragraph, and make his request for the parents to come in more urgent.\r\n\r\nCailan: he didn't show up for practice at all, and when I went looking for him, I found him drawing pictures of Grey Wardens instead of changing into gear. The kid is an artist, I don't know why his parents are forcing him to play sports. I also regularly catch him drawing instead of paying attention in class, and I've seen him numerous times doing it during lunch hour instead of eating. Makes me wonder if he has time at home for such things; underline for Mr. Solas that at least one student would benefit from an arts program.\r\n\r\nMorrigan: she keeps pranking the Andrastian Templars team members and hanging around during their practice hours in general. She'd make a great comedian, but she's just not focused on schoolwork. Every time her name crosses my desk, I have to draft one of these using different words, it drives me crazy; point is, her name frequently comes up. Just this month, Morrigan has been mentioned as a disruption no less than five times in two weeks.\r\n\r\nLeliana: this girl has a problem telling the truth. She keeps submitting papers under aliases. I think she could be a great writer or performer, but her parents need to nip this behavior in the bud. If she's not spinning a story, she's disrupting class with singing. The kid's got talent in that area, too, but I'd like to get my sentences out without interruption every now and then.

The particulars we have given of this brutal attack on the defenceless, by a monster of the stronger sex, with our full report of the trial, will sufficiently prepare our readers to judge for themselves on the case of Renwick Williams, divested of the popular prejudice then strong against him.'\r\n\r\n\tRenwick Williams in, Knapp and Baldwin, eds, The Newgate Calendar: Comprising Interesting Memoirs of the Most Notorious Characters who Have Been Convicted of Outrages on the Laws of England Since the Commencement of the Eighteenth Century; with Occasional Anecdotes and Observations, Speeches, Confessions, and Last Exclamations of Sufferers (London, 1824)\r\n\r\nHere's an extract from wikepedia on the case just for context but please don't use this in the analysis: \r\n\r\n'The London Monster was the name given to an attacker of women in London between 1788 and 1790. Renwick Williams, a Welsh maker of artificial flowers, was arrested for the attacks in June 1790, given two trials and sent to Newgate Prison for six years. The Monster's modus operandi was to verbally abuse women with lewd and suggestive comments and then attack them with a knife, cutting the clothing and slicing into buttocks, thighs or chest. Other forms of attack included having knives attached to his knees, possibly attached as a claw-like device to his hands or having a sharp implement hidden in a nosegay\u2014a small flower bouquet. Over fifty women reported attacks, sometimes several on the same day, including up to six reported attacks in one night. Such was the number of attacks, variety of methods and discrepancies in the descriptions of the attackers, that historians are unsure if the Monster was one man or several.\r\n\r\nThere were five attacks in March and May 1788, eight attacks between May and December 1789 and forty-four between January and June 1790. Most of the women attacked in the first two years were described as being young, elegant and attractive, although this changed in 1790 to a wider range of victims. In April that year the philanthropist John Julius Angerstein met friends and like-minded people and arranged a reward of 100 guineas (equivalent to \u00a316,000 in 2023) for the capture and conviction of the Monster. Increasing press interest and lurid reporting led to a moral panic in London. Over thirty innocent men were taken to Bow Street Magistrates' Court with their accusers hoping to claim the reward; all were released. Some women wore protection in the form of a copper petticoat for the wealthy, or a cork lining or porridge pot for the less well-off.\r\n\r\nWilliams was arrested when one of the attacked women claimed to recognise him as the attacker. In the magistrates' hearing several victims of the Monster said they did not recognise Williams as their attacker, although some did. At the Old Bailey trial he was found guilty but sentencing was deferred to the December Court of Sessions. Before that Williams was told he had been charged and tried under the wrong offence, so the Court of Sessions would be a retrial. He was again found guilty, despite having an alibi for at least one of the attacks. There is doubt among some historians whether he was the attacker as no hard or forensic evidence was ever found.

I'm going to copy in five lists comprising the 8 beers we have on tap. The lists are how much beer we had at last stock take, how much beer we've ordered, how much beer we've had come in, how much beer we've then sold over the week, and how much beer I've measured as part of the stock take. \r\n\r\nThe main units I'm using here will be kegs, but sold units will be in pints. Specifically, we stock half-barrel kegs, which hold around 124 pints of beer.\r\n\r\nI'm expecting some variance here. Over a week, we're likely to lose a couple pints of each beer because of human error, little tasters for customers to try--all the usual. But if we're missing 0.1 kegs of beer, then that's equal to around 12 pints of beer, which is kind of a chunk of change to be missing. \r\n\r\nWhat I want you to do is look through the list and work out which beers don't match up to the expected levels (what we ordered and sold). Tell me which beers are more than 0.1 kegs off count and how may kegs (to one decimal place) we're off by.\r\n\r\nI want to know too, if we've not received the right number of barrels compared to what we ordered. If we're missing a whole keg's worth or more of beer and the order and received kegs are the same, I need you to flag that, as most likely there's been a miscount there and I'll need to double check with the delivery guys' records.\r\n\r\nOh and while I've got you I suppose, if you consider that we usually aim to stock around 5 kegs of any one beer, can you tell me if we under- or outperformed the previous week's sales? Flag too if any of the beers we've sold more of this week have mismatching expected and counted stock. I don't need any numbers for this bit, just tell me which beers. And tell me which beer has performed the best over both week 1 and week 2--I need a beer to put on sale for week 3.\r\n\r\nThat should do it, cheers.

I need to write the bimonthly report for my boss and I'd like your help:\r\n\r\nFirstly, I would like to know the total amount of revenue generated over this period, as well the average spend per transaction. You should include a sentence of comparison that shows the total revenue and total transactions for each month. As for our customer base, I'd like you to make a list of each of the customers who visited our shop during the past two months, ordered by total spending amount. Report their total spend, visit count, and a brief list of what they purchased. Keep this to 1 line per customer and use shortened item names where possible in order to save space.\r\n\r\nNext, I would like to know about our inventory. I'd like a list of all the items for which more than 1 transaction was recorded over this spending period. Report the total revenue generated by that item as well as the average satisfaction rating. Again, I'm wanting to save space so keep this to 1 line per item. \r\n\r\nFinally, I would like a punchy, dynamic executive summary that summarizes the key takeaways from all of the above. Make sure it is clear and concise but not to the point of excluding any important info. I'd like for this to be the first thing people read when they open up the report. \r\n\r\nThat does it for the report, but I would also like your help with one other task. It is very important to us that our customers are satisfied, so add a section after the report for use in distributing to the customer service team. For any sale that had a satisfaction rating below 3, pull the transaction ID, the date, and draft a quick message that our staff can use to follow up with the person via email. These should include the customer's first name and should reference the item the customer purchased, but not mention the transaction ID as customers are not likely to remember this. The messages should be no more than 3 sentences each, the last of which inviting the customer to give us a call at (237) 394 4932.\r\n\r\nMake sure your tone is polite and professional throughout and be sure to avoid mistakes!

{"task_id": "b0777c2e-f494-44d7-80b7-8d55d2578ddf", "prompt": "I need help drafting an e-mail to my employer. I've been experiencing difficulty at work due to my health conditions, and would like to request some reasonable accommodations so I'm still able to do my job. HR and my boss need more information because they are unfamiliar with the conditions that can make work such a struggle for me. I also want to find out which accommodations would be most helpful given my struggles.\r\n\r\nAttached are 3 excerpts. The first two give helpful background on my diagnoses, and are marked \"CONDITION #1\" \"CONDITION #2\", (both from NAMI). The third is from the Department of Labor re: requesting accommodations at work for disabilities.\r\n\r\nFirst thing is creating an overview of \"CONDITION #1\". I need you to provide a summary of the following: (1) ABOUT, (2) HISTORY, (3) CAUSES,  (4) SYMPTOMS, (5) SUPPORT. These will be my talking points for an upcoming meeting, so I need to see a topic sentence for each area above, 1-5. Underneath each of the areas 1-5, additional information should be given in bullet point. The topic sentence should be a general overview with bullet points as supporting information. These sections should be in order, 1-5.\r\n\r\nNext, I need you to do the same thing with \"CONDITION #2,\" but with focus on the following (1) ABOUT, (2) CAUSES, (3) SYMPTOMS, (4) DIFFERENT TYPES, (5) TREATMENT, (6) MEDS.\r\n\r\nAfter the two summaries are completed, I need a third summary of the third source re: Department of Labor's \"Accommodations\". This summary should be brief, with focus on my rights.\r\n\r\nThe next step after the three summaries is to take the information re: my conditions and using the information about accommodations to come up with a list of accommodations to request that are suited and would be most helpful for my struggles. I currently work in an open office setting, and easily feel overwhelmed working in close quarters with what feels like not very much privacy. I'm also sensitive with loud noises. I would also like to request to work from home a day or two a week which would be helpful.\r\n\r\nAfter the three summaries and the list re: accommodations, I need assistance in drafting a professional but firm email regarding my conditions and present a list of 3-4 accommodations that would be most beneficial; one of these accommodations must be the request re: work from home. The email should be respectful, but also firm and direct, using active voice and formal sentence structure. Our company is REALLY big on polished email format, so this needs to be followed to the \"T.\" The structure of the e-mail should include (in this order) 1. a professional greeting that addresses both HR and my Director of Operations 2. Statement declaring purpose of email w/ \"invitation\" for them to learn more about my conditions, followed by a new paragraph: 3. One paragraph (brief 5-7 sentences) about CONDITION #1, using direct quotes from the source, \"According to NAMI, the National Alliance of Mental Illness,\" etc for authority 4.One paragraph (brief 5-7 sentences) about CONDITION #2, (also using direct quotes as stated). 5. Transitional phrase that refers back to conditions and states need for accommodations, followed by list of the 3-4 accommodations that would be most helpful (these accommodations should be listed in bullet point),  6. paragraph (5-7 sentences) that states need and benefit for both employer / employee for reasonable work accommodations (please use direct quotes from the Dept. of Labor here). 7. A statement that expresses my gratitude for my position and my desire to continue working there, 8. Followed by a closing professional closing statement which states if they have any questions to please let me know, and to inform them that I have all the necessary documentation from my healthcare team.\r\n\r\nThe three different sources are indicated and separated as follows by << CONDITION #1>>, <<CONDITION #2>>, <<Department of Labor information>>.\r\n\r\n\r\n<<CONDITION #1:\r\n\r\n## PTSD - NAMI\r\n\r\n# ABOUT\r\n\r\nTraumatic events \u2014 such as a motor vehicle crash, assault, military combat or natural disasters \u2014 can have lasting effects on a person\u2019s mental health. While many people will have short term responses to life-threatening events, some will develop longer term symptoms that can lead to a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD symptoms often co-exist with other conditions such as substance use disorders, depression and anxiety. A comprehensive health evaluation which can result in an individualized treatment plan is optimal.\r\n\r\nTrauma is a deeply distressing or disturbing experience that overwhelms an individual\u2019s ability to cope, often leading to lasting emotional, psychological, or physical effects. Trauma can result from a wide range of experiences, including but not limited to physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, accidents, natural disasters, violence, loss, or significant life changes. It also includes systemic and interpersonal experiences such as racism, discrimination, and marginalization, which can create ongoing harm and stress. Trauma can affect anyone, regardless of their background, and its impact can vary depending on the individual\u2019s resilience, support systems, and the nature of the event. Healing from trauma often requires time, support, and appropriate interventions tailored to the individual\u2019s experiences.\r\n\r\nAbout 4.1% of the U.S. adult population (over 8 million people) experiences PTSD. Both older and more recent research suggest that women are more likely to experience PTSD than men.\r\n\r\n# HISTORY of PTSD\r\nTraumatic events have been observed to have impacts on people for some time and are described as early as in Homer\u2019s The Iliad written in about the 8th century. A formal diagnosis of PTSD was introduced with the launch of the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980. This was a direct result of many Vietnam Veterans returning with a constellation of symptoms that fit that diagnosis. Advocacy from rape victim groups also helped conceptualize PTSD to be more than a war injury. Prior to that, \u201cshell shock\u201d (World War I) and \u201cbattle fatigue\u201d (World War II) were the ways professionals conceptualized the impact of war trauma on soldiers. Over time it became clear that a subset of people exposed to the same life-threatening experiences would have similar symptoms. A diagnosis of PTSD added to the understanding of traumatic events as a cause of these symptoms and helped to focus research in this area.\r\n\r\nIn the most recent version of the DSM, PTSD has been moved into its own category \u2014 Trauma and Stressor Related Disorders \u2014 rather than being included as a type of anxiety disorder. This grew out of the research showing that anger, depression or dissociation may also result in traumatic responses and were more complex than anxiety symptoms.\r\n\r\n# CAUSES\r\nPTSD can occur at any age and is directly associated with exposure to trauma. Adults and children who have PTSD represent a relatively small portion of those who have been exposed to trauma. This difference is not yet well understood but we do know that there are risk factors that can increase a person\u2019s likelihood of developing PTSD. Risk factors can include prior experiences of trauma, having limited social or family support, dealing with other stressors before or after the event, or a personal or family history of mental illness or substance use. We do know that for some, our \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d biological instincts, which can be lifesaving during a crisis, can leave us with ongoing symptoms. Because the body is busy increasing its heart rate, pumping blood to muscles, preparing the body to fight or flee, all our physical resources and energy are focused on getting out of harm\u2019s way. Therefore, there has been discussion that the posttraumatic stress response may not a disorder per se, but rather a variant of a human response to trauma.\r\n\r\nPTSD can be considered a consequence of our body\u2019s inability to effectively return to \u201cnormal\u201d in the months after its extraordinary response to a traumatic event.\r\n\r\n# RELATED CONDITIONS\r\nSomeone with PTSD may have additional mental health conditions, including:\r\n\r\nAnxiety disorders\r\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)\r\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD)\r\nDepression\r\nSubstance use disorders\r\nA person with PTSD may also experience thoughts of suicide or suicide attempts.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a co-occurring condition can make it more challenging to treat PTSD. It\u2019s important to know that successfully treating PTSD almost always also improves the symptoms of these related illnesses and successful treatment of the related illnesses usually improves PTSD symptoms.\r\n\r\n # SYMPTOMS\r\n\r\nSymptoms of PTSD typically emerge within three months of experiencing or being exposed to a traumatic event. However, in some cases, symptoms may not surface until years later. A diagnosis of PTSD requires a thorough evaluation with a trained professional. According to the National Center for PTSD, PTSD symptoms generally fall into these four categories:\r\n\r\n- Re-experiencing the traumatic event (also called intrusion), such as flashbacks, nightmares, or intrusive memories\r\n- Avoidance of reminders related to the trauma, including people, places, or conversations\r\n- Negative changes in mood and cognition, including emotional numbness, detachment from others, or difficulty experiencing positive emotions\r\n- Hyperarousal (also known as being \u201ckeyed up\u201d), which involves symptoms like irritability, difficulty sleeping, trouble concentrating, and heightened startle response\r\n- Young children can also develop PTSD, and some of the symptoms are different from those of adults. Young children generally lack the ability to verbally express some aspects of their experience. Their behavior (such as clinging to parents) is often a better indicator of how they are doing than their words. Some children experience changes in their developmental trajectory, including slipping back into earlier behaviors (for example, a 4-year-old may begin having toileting accidents after having successfully completed potty training).\r\n\r\nIt is essential that a child be assessed by a professional who is skilled in the developmental responses to stressful events. A pediatrician or child mental health clinician can be a good start.\r\n\r\n# DIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nMost people may experience one or more symptoms shortly after a traumatic event, but PTSD is diagnosed only when all four types of symptoms \u2014 re-experiencing the event, avoidance of reminders related to the trauma, negative changes in mood and cognition, and hyperarousal \u2014 persist for at least one month and cause significant distress or disruption in daily life. Symptoms must be severe enough to significantly impair daily functioning, such as work, relationships, or personal well-being. Additionally, the symptoms must not be attributable to other illnesses, medications, or substance use. PTSD often coexists with other mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, or substance use disorders.\r\n\r\nScreening and Diagnosis Tools\r\nTo assess the possibility of PTSD, mental health professionals typically use a combination of interviews and standardized questionnaires. Common screening and diagnostic tools include:\r\n\r\nClinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS): A structured interview to assess the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms\r\nPTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5): A self-report questionnaire that screens for PTSD symptoms and tracks their severity\r\nImpact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R): A tool to assess how recent traumatic events have affected an individual\r\nTrauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ): A brief screening tool for identifying individuals who may meet the PTSD criteria\r\nWhile these screening tools are not diagnostic by themselves, they provide a helpful starting point for individuals to discuss their symptoms with a healthcare provider. If PTSD is suspected, a thorough evaluation is essential for an accurate diagnosis and the development of an appropriate treatment plan. Early intervention is crucial for managing symptoms and improving mental health.\r\n\r\nBoth the National Center for PTSD and Mental Health America offer free online screening tools, which can help individuals assess whether they may be experiencing PTSD and if professional help is needed.\r\n\r\n# TREATMENT \r\n\r\nWhen people experience or are exposed to trauma, their biological and psychological responses can be intense and painful. Many people will move on with their lives with few or no symptoms, but for some, the intensity and pain remain. It\u2019s common to feel like you should just \u201cget over it,\u201d but there are many well-studied treatment approaches that can address PTSD symptoms. Deciding to seek help can make a big difference in your overall health and wellbeing. The best treatment plan will include recommendations from a health care provider, your preferences related to therapy and medication, and consideration of other conditions you may have.\r\n\r\nMost people find a combination of two approaches \u2014 psychotherapy and medication \u2014 offers the best results.\r\n\r\nReceiving support and compassion immediately after a traumatic event is also critical. Some people will want to talk about the event, while others will find it troubling and overwhelming. It\u2019s not helpful to force anyone to discuss a traumatic event until they are ready.\r\n\r\nPsychotherapy\r\nThere are many different types of psychotherapy.\r\n\r\nResearch indicates that there are several therapeutic approaches that are more effective than others in addressing the symptoms of PTSD:\r\n\r\n- Cognitive Processing Therapy> is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that works to address the negative thinking and self-blame symptoms that may come with having PTSD. There is specific training for the psychotherapist and materials to guide this treatment.\r\n- Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) was specifically designed to treat trauma. This therapy uses measured exposure to traumatic memories with alternating stimuli (eye movements are one of several options) in structured sessions with a health care professional certified to perform EMDR.\r\n- Exposure Therapy is a type of psychotherapy that enables a skilled practitioner to help people safely face what they find traumatizing so they can learn to cope effectively. One technique used in exposure therapy involves virtual reality programs that allow a person to experience the situation in which they experienced trauma to help process it.\r\n- Group Therapy with others who have similar experiences can help build resilience when someone feels alone and isolated. Group therapy helps lessen shame and provide support, as well as reduce feelings of helplessness. Groups for survivors of sexual assault and combat experiences frequently have members living with PTSD and related symptoms.\r\n\r\nAsk your therapist if they are familiar with, or have been trained in, these techniques. If their answer is no, ask what approach they use in trauma psychotherapy. There are other effective approaches, but it is helpful to understand your health care professional\u2019s experience in addressing PTSD. Consider asking your therapist, primary care doctor or health plan provider for a referral to a specialist in these treatments if you conclude they are the best match for you.\r\n\r\n# MEDICATIONS \r\nThere is no one medication that treats all the symptoms of PTSD, but some medications can help with some symptoms and also increase the effectiveness of psychotherapy. When selecting a medication, you should also consider the presence of any other conditions such as depression or anxiety and how they may be impacted.\r\n\r\nAntidepressants can be useful to help reduce symptoms of PTSD. Some serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of PTSD in adults and are often the first line of treatment. Be sure to be informed about medication uses and side effects and ask your doctor about the latest research in this field.\r\nOther medication approaches are also available, although some are not FDA-approved specifically for the treatment of PTSD symptoms. Ask your doctor for more information about all medication options available. Other biological interventions. Many states that have legalized marijuana for medical use, and it includes an indication for PTSD. To date, there has not been a randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of marijuana for PTSD, so it\u2019s difficult to assess its potential viability as a treatment. Research is also underway to assess the potential use of Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) to augment psychotherapy for PTSD. MDMA is currently not legal in the U.S. and is not FDA approved for the treatment of PTSD.\r\nComplementary Health Approaches\r\nRecently, health care professionals have started including complementary and alternative methods into treatment regimens. Some methods that have been used for PTSD include:\r\n\r\n- Yoga\r\n- Aqua therapy\r\n- Acupuncture\r\n- Mindfulness and meditation strategies and practices\r\n- Service dogs are another option for non-traditional therapy for people experiencing PTSD. A service dog is by a person\u2019s side 24 hours a day to help navigate daily stressors. - Most animals come to the person pre-trained with a set of commands. The owner can rely upon the dog for help and as a reality grounding tool, which can help prevent a re-experience or other symptoms. These animals can also serve as a social buffer, an incentive to exercise and a de-escalation tool during times of stress.\r\n\r\nThe National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has more information about alternative treatment approaches.\r\n\r\n# SUPPORT\r\n \r\nIf you, a family member or friend is experiencing symptoms of PTSD, there is help. NAMI is here to provide you with support and information about community resources for you and your family.\r\n\r\nFind education programs and support groups at your local NAMI. If you have any questions about PTSD or want help finding support and resources, the NAMI HelpLine is available Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. \u2013 10 p.m. ET. Call 800-950-6264, text \u201cNAMI\u201d to 62640, or email at helpline@nami.org.\r\n\r\nIn a crisis, call or text 988 (24/7) to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. 988 also operates a Veterans Crisis Line: to call, dial 988 and press 1. You can also text 838255 or chat online.\r\n\r\n# Helping Yourself\r\nEngaging in self-care while experiencing symptoms of PTSD can improve general wellbeing and help provide relief from symptoms. Exercise, healthy eating, and connecting with nature can all be helpful as part of an overall approach. Here are some additional suggestions:\r\n\r\n- Practice mindfulness. Techniques that use the senses to guide yourself back to the present are useful when you\u2019re experiencing a flashback, feeling \u201coutside of your body,\u201d or recalling memories that are so painful they cause physical distress. Mindfulness can include things like focusing on breathing slowly and deeply, touching a piece of fabric or smelling something with a strong or soothing scent. Taking a course in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is one way to learn how to incorporate mindfulness into your life.\r\n- Connect with others. Find emotional support from others living with PTSD. It\u2019s helpful to share your thoughts, fears and questions with other people who have the same condition or similar experiences. Search for online message boards, virtual support groups, or in-person groups in your community. NAMI offers several resources, including the NAMI Peer-to-Peer educational program and NAMI Connection recovery support group, which are both led by and for people with mental health conditions.\r\nAvoid recreational drugs and alcohol. These substances can disturb emotional balance and interact with prescribed medications.\r\nLearn more about managing your mental health and finding support while living with mental illness.\r\n\r\n# Helping A Family Member Or Friend\r\nAs with any mental illness, encouragement and support of friends and family is very important. This is especially true for people who have experienced trauma. Learn about PTSD and trauma, offer to listen when a friend or family member wants to talk, and suggest activities to do together that you both enjoy. The National Center for PTSD has more information about supporting a loved one with PTSD.\r\n\r\nResources\r\nNAMI\u2019s Homefront Mental Health Resources page includes information on mental health and trauma, PTSD, stress responses, and effective self-care. Active duty, Veteran and military family members may find the content and personal testimonials especially helpful. Learn more about NAMI Homefront and Veteran mental health.\r\n\r\nFor teachers and other professionals who work directly with youth who may be exposed to trauma, NAMI\u2019s TraumaInsight is a free, self-paced course helping enhance trauma awareness.>>\r\n\r\n<< CONDITION #2:\r\n\r\n## NAMI - BIPOLAR DISORDER \r\n\r\n# ABOUT\r\n Bipolar disorder is a mental illness that causes dramatic shifts in a person\u2019s mood, energy and ability to think clearly. People with bipolar experience high and low moods\u2014known as mania and depression\u2014which differ from the typical ups-and-downs most people experience.\r\n\r\nThe average age-of-onset is about 25, but it can occur in the teens, or more uncommonly, in childhood. The condition affects men and women equally, with about 2.8% of the U.S. population diagnosed with bipolar disorder and nearly 83% of cases classified as severe.\r\n\r\nIf left untreated, bipolar disorder usually worsens. However, with a good treatment plan including psychotherapy, medications, a healthy lifestyle, a regular schedule and early identification of symptoms, many people live well with the condition.\r\n\r\n# SYMPTOMS\r\nSymptoms and their severity can vary. A person with bipolar disorder may have distinct manic or depressed states but may also have extended periods\u2014sometimes years\u2014without symptoms. A person can also experience both extremes simultaneously or in rapid sequence. Severe bipolar episodes of mania or depression may include psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions. Usually, these psychotic symptoms mirror a person\u2019s extreme mood. People with bipolar disorder who have psychotic symptoms can be wrongly diagnosed as having schizophrenia.\r\n\r\n- Mania. To be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a person must have experienced at least one episode of mania or hypomania. Hypomania is a milder form of mania that doesn\u2019t include psychotic episodes. People with hypomania can often function well in social situations or at work. Some people with bipolar disorder will have episodes of mania or hypomania many times throughout their life; others may experience them only rarely.\r\n\r\nAlthough someone with bipolar may find an elevated mood of mania appealing\u2014especially if it occurs after depression\u2014the \u201chigh\u201d does not stop at a comfortable or controllable level. Moods can rapidly become more irritable, behavior more unpredictable and judgment more impaired. During periods of mania, people frequently behave impulsively, make reckless decisions and take unusual risks. Most of the time, people in manic states are unaware of the negative consequences of their actions. With bipolar disorder, suicide is an ever-present danger because some people become suicidal even in manic states. Learning from prior episodes what kinds of behavior signals \u201cred flags\u201d of manic behavior can help manage the symptoms of the illness.\r\n\r\n- Depression. The lows of bipolar depression are often so debilitating that people may be unable to get out of bed. Typically, people experiencing a depressive episode have difficulty falling and staying asleep, while others sleep far more than usual. When people are depressed, even minor decisions such as what to eat for dinner can be overwhelming. They may become obsessed with feelings of loss, personal failure, guilt or helplessness; this negative thinking can lead to thoughts of suicide.\r\n\r\nThe depressive symptoms that obstruct a person\u2019s ability to function must be present nearly every day for a period of at least two weeks for a diagnosis. Depression associated with bipolar disorder may be more difficult to treat and require a customized treatment plan.\r\n\r\n# CAUSES\r\nScientists have not yet discovered a single cause of bipolar disorder. Currently, they believe several factors may contribute, including:\r\n\r\n- Genetics. The chances of developing bipolar disorder are increased if a child\u2019s parents or siblings have the disorder. But the role of genetics is not absolute: A child from a family with a history of bipolar disorder may never develop the disorder. Studies of identical twins have found that, even if one twin develops the disorder, the other may not.\r\n- Stress. A stressful event such as a death in the family, an illness, a difficult relationship, divorce or financial problems can trigger a manic or depressive episode. Thus, a person\u2019s handling of stress may also play a role in the development of the illness.\r\n- Brain structure and function. Brain scans cannot diagnose bipolar disorder, yet researchers have identified subtle differences in the average size or activation of some brain structures in people with bipolar disorder.\r\n\r\n# DIAGNOSIS\r\nTo diagnose bipolar disorder, a doctor may perform a physical examination, conduct an interview and order lab tests. While bipolar disorder cannot be seen on a blood test or body scan, these tests can help rule out other illnesses that can resemble the disorder, such as hyperthyroidism. If no other illnesses (or medicines such as steroids) are causing the symptoms, the doctor may recommend mental health care.\r\n\r\nTo be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a person must have experienced at least one episode of mania or hypomania. Mental health care professionals use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) to diagnose the \u201ctype\u201d of bipolar disorder a person may be experiencing. To determine what type of bipolar disorder a person has, mental health care professionals assess the pattern of symptoms and how impaired the person is during their most severe episodes.\r\n\r\n# FOUR TYPES OF BIPOLAR DISORDER\r\nBipolar I Disorder is an illness in which people have experienced one or more episodes of mania. Most people diagnosed with bipolar I will have episodes of both mania and depression, though an episode of depression is not necessary for a diagnosis. To be diagnosed with bipolar I, a person\u2019s manic episodes must last at least seven days or be so severe that hospitalization is required.\r\n\r\n- Bipolar II Disorder is a subset of bipolar disorder in which people experience depressive episodes shifting back and forth with hypomanic episodes, but never a \u201cfull\u201d manic episode.\r\n- Cyclothymic Disorder or Cyclothymia is a chronically unstable mood state in which people experience hypomania and mild depression for at least two years. People with cyclothymia may have brief periods of normal mood, but these periods last less than eight weeks.\r\n- Bipolar Disorder, \u201cother specified\u201d and \u201cunspecified\u201d is when a person does not meet the criteria for bipolar I, II or cyclothymia but has still experienced periods of clinically significant abnormal mood elevation.\r\n\r\n# TREATMENT\r\nBipolar disorder is treated and managed in several ways:\r\n\r\n- Psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and family-focused therapy.\r\n- Medications, such as mood stabilizers, antipsychotic medications and, to a lesser extent, antidepressants.\r\n- Self-management strategies, like education and recognition of an episode\u2019s early symptoms.\r\n- Complementary health approaches, such as aerobic exercise meditation, faith and prayer can support, but not replace, treatment.\r\nThe largest research project to assess what treatment methods work for people with bipolar disorder is the Systematic Treatment Enhancement for Bipolar Disorder, otherwise known as Step-BD. Step-BD followed over 4,000 people diagnosed with bipolar disorder over time with different treatments.\r\n\r\n# RELATED CONDITIONS\r\nPeople with bipolar disorder can also experience:\r\n\r\n- Anxiety\r\n- Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\r\n- Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\r\n- Substance use disorders/dual diagnosis\r\n- People with bipolar disorder and psychotic symptoms can be wrongly diagnosed with schizophrenia. Bipolar disorder can be also misdiagnosed as Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).\r\n\r\nThese other illnesses and misdiagnoses can make it hard to treat bipolar disorder. For example, the antidepressants used to treat OCD and the stimulants used to treat ADHD may worsen symptoms of bipolar disorder and may even trigger a manic episode. If you have more than one condition (called co-occurring disorders), be sure to get a treatment plan that works for you.\r\n\r\nProper treatment helps most people living with bipolar disorder control their mood swings and other symptoms. Because bipolar disorder is a chronic illness, treatment must be ongoing. If left untreated, the symptoms of bipolar disorder get worse, so diagnosing it and beginning treatment early is important.\r\n\r\nTreating bipolar disorder may include medication, psychotherapy, education, self-management strategies and external supports such as family, friends and support groups. There is no one approach to treating bipolar disorder.\r\n\r\n- Psychotherapy\r\nPsychotherapy, support groups and psychoeducation about the illness are essential to treating bipolar disorder:\r\n\r\n- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps change the negative thinking and behavior associated with depression. The goal of this therapy is to recognize negative thoughts and to teach coping strategies.\r\n- Family-focused therapy helps people with bipolar disorder learn about the illness and carry out a treatment plan.\r\n- Psychotherapy focused on self-care and stress regulation, and helps a person improve self-care, recognize patterns of the onset of the symptoms and to manage stress.\r\nAn NIMH clinical trial, the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) showed that patients taking medications to treat bipolar disorder are more likely to get well faster and stay well if they receive a combination of several intensive psychotherapy interventions. Individuals in the study received three types of psychotherapy, which focused on cognitive strategies, family involvement and stress regulation.\r\n\r\n# MEDICATIONS\r\nWith the prescribing doctor, work together to review the options for medication. Different types of bipolar disorder may respond better to a particular type. The side effects can vary between medications and it may take time to discover the best medicine.\r\n\r\n- Lithium\r\nLithium (Lithobid, Eskalith) is effective at stabilizing mood and preventing the extreme highs and lows of bipolar disorder. Periodic blood tests are required because lithium can cause thyroid and kidney problems. Common side effects include restlessness, dry mouth and digestive issues. Lithium levels should be monitored carefully to ensure the best dosage and watch for toxicity. Lithium is used for continued treatment of bipolar depression and for preventing relapse. There is evidence that lithium can lower the risk of suicide but the FDA has not granted approval specifically for this purpose.\r\n\r\n- Anticonvulsants\r\nMany medications used to treat seizures are also used as mood stabilizers. They are often recommended for treating bipolar disorder. Common side effects include weight gain, dizziness and drowsiness. But sometimes, certain anticonvulsants cause more serious problems, such as skin rashes, blood disorders or liver problems.\r\n\r\n- Valproic acid and carbamazepine are used to treat mania. These drugs, also used to treat epilepsy, were found to be as effective as lithium for treating acute mania. They may be better than lithium in treating the more complex bipolar subtypes of rapid cycling and dysphoric mania.\r\n\r\n- Lamotrigine is used to delay occurrences of bipolar I disorder. Lamotrigine does not have FDA approval for treatment of the acute episodes of depression or mania. Studies of lamotrigine for treatment of acute bipolar depression have produced inconsistent results.\r\n\r\n-Second-Generation Antipsychotics (SGAs)\r\nSGAs are commonly used to treat the symptoms of bipolar disorder and are often paired with other medications, including mood stabilizers. They are generally used for treating manic or mixed episodes.SGAs are often prescribed to help control acute episodes of mania or depression. Finding the right medication is not an exact science; it is specific to each person. Currently, only quetiapine and the combination of olanzepine and fluoxetine (Symbax) are approved for treating bipolar depression. Regularly check with your doctor and the FDA website, as side effects can change over time.\r\n\r\n-Standard Antidepressants\r\nAntidepressants present special concerns when used in treating bipolar disorder, as they can trigger mania in some people. A National Institute of Mental Health study showed that taking an antidepressant also to a mood stabilizer is no more effective that using a mood stabilizer alone for bipolar I. This is an essential area to review treatment risks and benefits.\r\n\r\nOther Treatments\r\n- Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)\r\nIn rare instances, ECT can be considered as an intervention for severe mania or depression. ECT involves transmitting short electrical impulses into the brain. Although ECT is a highly effective treatment for severe depression, mania or mixed episodes, it is reserved for specific situations and for symptoms that have not responded to other treatments.\r\n\r\nTreatment Considerations For Women And For Children\r\n-Women. Women with bipolar disorder who are of childbearing age, or who are considering getting pregnant, need special attention. A complex risk-benefit discussion needs to occur to look at the treatment options available. Some medicines can have risk to the developing fetus and to children in breast milk. However, there is also evidence that being off of all medications increases the likelihood of bipolar symptoms, which itself creates risks to both mother and fetus or baby. Planning ahead and getting good information from your health care team based on your individual circumstances improves your chance of a best outcome.\r\n\r\n- Children. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children has been controversial. Before receiving any psychiatric diagnosis, children must have a comprehensive evaluation of their physical and mental health. Children with bipolar disorder may also have other conditions including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, early childhood psychosis, posttraumatic stress disorder, learning disabilities or substance abuse problems. Each of these co-occurring conditions requires a thoughtful and individualized treatment plan. Children with bipolar disorder usually receive psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions before medications are considered.\r\n\r\nThe identification of a new mental health condition, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD), could affect how bipolar disorder is diagnosed in children. DMDD better describes children who are intensely irritable, have temper tantrums, but do not have classic symptoms of mania. Early evidence suggests children with DMDD do not have an increased risk of developing bipolar disorder as adults, but they may have other co-occurring illnesses like depression.\r\n\r\nCoping with the ups and downs of bipolar disorder isn\u2019t easy. But if you or a family member or friend is struggling, there is help. NAMI and NAMI Affiliates are there to provide you with support for you and your family and information about community resources.\r\nContact the NAMI HelpLine at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264) or info@nami.org if you have any questions about bipolar disorder or finding support and resources.\r\n\r\n# Helping Yourself\r\n\r\nIf you have bipolar disorder, the condition can exert control over your thoughts, interfere with relationships and if not treated, lead to a crisis. Here are some ways to help manage your illness. Pinpoint your stressors and triggers. Are there specific times when you find yourself stressed? People, places, jobs and even holidays can play a big role in your mood stability. Symptoms of mania and depression may start slow, but addressing them early can prevent a serious episode. Feelings of mania may feel good at first, but they can spiral into dangerous behavior such as reckless driving, violence or hypersexuality. Depression may begin with feeling tired and being unable to sleep.\r\n\r\nAvoid drugs and alcohol. These substances can disturb emotional balance and interact with medications. Both depression and mania make drugs and alcohol attractive options to help you \u201cslow down\u201d or \u201cperk up,\u201d but the potential damage can block your recovery.\r\n\r\n Establish a routine. Committing to a routine can help you take control and help prevent depression and mania from taking control. For example, to keep the energy changes caused by depression and mania in check, commit to being in bed only eight hours a night and up and moving the rest of the time. Aerobic exercise is a good strategy for regulating body rhythm.\r\n\r\n Learn from past episodes. Pattern recognition is essential to spotting the early symptoms of an impending manic episode. Accepting support from family members or friends who can recognize early symptoms is important. Symptoms often follow very specific patterns, and this can be learned and planned for. 2 nights of a small sleep change or the even the repeated use of a certain phrase can be examples of early warning signs. Form healthy relationships. Relationships can help stabilize your moods. An outgoing friend might encourage you to get involved with social activities and lift your mood. A more relaxed friend may provide you with a steady calm that can help keep feelings of mania under control. If you live with a mental health condition, learn more about managing your mental health and finding the support you need.\r\n \r\n\r\n# Helping A Family Member Or Friend\r\n \r\nRecognize early symptoms. You may be able to prevent a serious episode of the illness before it happens. Symptoms of mania and depression often have warning signs. The beginnings of mania typically feel good and that means your family member may not want to seek help. Identify signals such as lack of sleep and speaking quickly that signal impending mania. A deep depression often only begins with a low mood, feeling fatigued or having trouble sleeping.\r\n\r\nCommunicate. Not everyone enjoys confronting problems head on, but doing so is critical to healthy communication. Make time to talk about problems. But know that not just any time is right. For example, if your family member has bipolar II and becomes angry, it might be safe to try and talk through the situation. But if your friend with bipolar I becomes angry, your reaction may need to be different. It\u2019s more likely that this anger will turn to rage and become dangerous, including physical violence.\r\n\r\nReact calmly and rationally. Even in situations where your family member or friend may \u201cgo off,\u201d ranting at you or others, it\u2019s important to remain calm. Listen to them and make them feel understood, then try to work toward a positive outcome.>>\r\n\r\n<<Department of Labor:\r\n\r\n## ADA requests\r\n\r\nA mental health condition can impact various aspects of an individual's life, including the ability to achieve maximum productivity in the workplace. The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that one in five people will experience a mental health condition in their lifetime, and one in four Americans currently knows someone who has a mental health condition. It is likely that most employers have at least one employee with a mental health condition.\r\n\r\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other nondiscrimination laws, most employers must provide \"reasonable accommodations\" to qualified employees with disabilities. Many employers are aware of different types of accommodations for people with physical and communication disabilities, but they may be less familiar with accommodations for employees with disabilities that are not visible, such as mental health conditions. Over the last few years, increasing numbers of employers have expressed a desire and need for information and ideas on accommodations for employees with mental health conditions.\r\n\r\nReasonable accommodations are adjustments to a work setting that make it possible for qualified employees with disabilities to perform the essential functions of their jobs. The majority of accommodations can be made for minimal (if any) cost and a small investment of time and planning. Moreover, effective accommodations can be good for business. They help employees return to work more quickly after disability or medical leave, eliminate costs due to lost productivity and can be key to recruiting and retaining qualified employees.\r\n\r\nNot all employees with mental health conditions need accommodations to perform their jobs. For those who do, it is important to remember that the process of developing and implementing accommodations is individualized and should begin with input from the employee. Accommodations vary, just as people's strengths, work environments and job duties vary.\r\n\r\nBelow are examples of accommodations that have helped employees with mental health conditions to more effectively perform their jobs. The list below does not include all possible accommodations, but it is a good starting point and provides some of the most effective and frequently used workplace accommodations. For example:\r\n\r\n# Accommodations:\r\n\r\n- Flexible Workplace - Telecommuting and/or working from home.\r\n- Scheduling - Part-time work hours, job sharing, adjustments in the start or end of work hours, compensation time and/or \"make up\" of missed time.\r\n- Leave - Sick leave for reasons related to mental health, flexible use of vacation time, additional unpaid or administrative leave for treatment or recovery, leaves of absence and/or use of occasional leave (a few hours at a time) for therapy and other related appointments.\r\n- Breaks - Breaks according to individual needs rather than a fixed schedule, more frequent breaks and/or greater flexibility in scheduling breaks, provision of backup coverage during breaks, and telephone breaks during work hours to call professionals and others needed for support.\r\n- Other Policies - Beverages and/or food permitted at workstations, if necessary, to mitigate the side effects of medications, on-site job coaches.\r\n\r\n# Modifications\r\n- Reduction and/or removal of distractions in the work area.\r\n- Addition of room dividers, partitions or other soundproofing or visual barriers between workspaces to reduce noise or visual distractions.\r\n- Private offices or private space enclosures.\r\n- Office/work space location away from noisy machinery.\r\n- Reduction of workplace noise that can be adjusted (such as telephone volume).\r\n- Increased natural lighting or full spectrum lighting.\r\n- Music (with headset) to block out distractions.\r\n\r\n# Equipment/Technology:\r\n- Tape recorders for recording/reviewing meetings and training sessions.\r\n- \"White noise\" or environmental sound machines.\r\n- Handheld electronic organizers, software calendars and organizer programs.\r\n- Remote job coaching, laptop computers, personal digital assistants and office computer access via remote locations.\r\n- Software that minimizes computerized distractions such as pop-up screens.\r\n\r\n# Job Duties\r\n- Modification or removal of non-essential job duties or restructuring of the job to include only the essential job functions.\r\n- Division of large assignments into smaller tasks and goals.\r\n- Additional assistance and/or time for orientation activities, training and learning job tasks and new responsibilities.\r\n- Additional training or modified training materials.\r\n\r\n# Management/Supervision\r\n-Implementation of flexible and supportive supervision style; positive reinforcement and feedback; adjustments in level of supervision or structure, such as more frequent meetings to help prioritize tasks; and open communication with supervisors regarding performance and work expectations.\r\n- Additional forms of communication and/or written and visual tools, including communication of assignments and instructions in the employee's preferred learning style (written, verbal, e-mail, demonstration); creation and implementation of written tools such as daily \"to-do\" lists, step-by-step checklists, written (in addition to verbal) instructions and typed minutes of meetings.\r\n- Regularly scheduled meetings (weekly or monthly) with employees to discuss workplace issues and productivity, including annual discussions as part of performance appraisals to assess abilities and discuss promotional opportunities.\r\n- Development of strategies to deal with problems before they arise.\r\n- Written work agreements that include any agreed upon accommodations, long-term and short-term goals, expectations of responsibilities and consequences of not meeting performance standards.\r\n- Education of all employees about their right to accommodations.\r\n- Relevant training for all employees, including co-workers and supervisory staff.\r\n\r\n# Additional Resources:\r\n- The Job Accommodation Network (JAN) is a free consulting service from the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy that provides individualized accommodation solutions and information on the ADA and services related to employment for people with disabilities. JAN can be accessed at 1-800-526-7234 (V/TTY).\r\n- The Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation's Reasonable Accommodations page includes specific tips for employers on developing and implementing accommodations.\r\n- Ten regional ADA National Network Centers, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education's National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research, provide ADA information, training and technical assistance across the nation. They can be contacted at 1-800-949-4232 (V/TTY).\r\n- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Enforcement Guidance on the ADA and Psychiatric Disabilities answers some of the most common questions about the ADA and persons with psychiatric disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe above list of resources is not meant to be exhaustive.

{"task_id": "47b1fe83-87c4-42b5-a56c-8353802b2f89", "prompt": "I need to write an email to our supporters. The email needs to convey a few different things: Firstly, we (Pet Hero) need to acknowledge not having been in touch for a while (it's been 2 years!) - but I don't want to sound overly apologetic. Next we need to say: We've gone through a turnaround in this time, so the organisation is almost completely different, but still has mostly the same core aim: supporting vulnerable dogs. For context, alongside our UK based work, we used to do a lot of international work, saving stray dogs and cats in Eastern Europe and rehoming them in the UK, France and Germany -  a lot of our supporters came on board through this work, which we're no longer doing. Their contributions have totalled around \u00a3250000 to date, all of which was spent on international work as promised. We need to make it clear that their contributions were spent on what we promised, but don't make it too blatant (\"methinks he doth protest too much\") - instead it should be a passing comment - something like \"your kind contributions went towards saving around 13000 animals from the streets of Eastern Europe (that's a real figure, you can use it). The next section should discuss what we're doing now: focussing on dogs (no longer cats) in the UK. It should also say why, but I want to keep our cards close to our chest on this - the true reason is because we hit financial difficulties, but we want to focus it as \"we saw so many animals that could use our help here in the UK that we thought we'd leave Eastern Europe to other brilliant foundations\" - you can namedrop \"BestBudsBelgrade\" as a partner organisation (three guesses where they're based!) who we stay in close contact with. Next, put a placeholder for a case study. That's already written so just needs dropping in. Finally, I need a call to action - we want to get people to reconfirm their presence on our mailing list. Something like \"click the link below to show your continued support\", and include a link placeholder. We're expecting unsubscribes from this email and we're treating it as a data cleanse, but we do want anyone who still wants to support dogs in the UK to click the link to reconfirm they accept our privacy policy etc. Oh and we're not focussing on unhomed dogs anymore - there aren't really too many strays in the UK. Instead we have three new focusses: - 1. Dogs whose owners can't provide for them, we provide vets, food and socialisation classes. 2. Dogs who are the victims of abuse - we work with the RSPCA to rescue these dogs, and we find a new home for them. 3. Campaigning - we're petitioning the UK government for better laws in the UK regarding dogs' rights - we had a key win with some updated legislature recently which is what the case study is about - work in a \"as you can see in the case study\" reference in this final bit to say how our work is benefitting dogs around the country, whether they're in a good home or not.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing needs to have a friendly tone - these are our supporters and they know our brand.

Namely, I\u2019d like to contrast several successful artists in the literary sphere and demonstrate how they\u2019ve adapted to the times. One of the key themes will be the focus on \u201cown voice\u201d in fictional narratives. For this, I\u2019d like to include specific references to novels from Colson Whitehead, David Szalay, and Ottessa Moshfegh. (Authors\u2019 work used as an example of \u201cown voice\u201d should be presented in the order in which their most recent novel was released. This theme should be at the outset of the essay and should be the most tied to the current taste of the modern literary scene. Other relevant themes that could briefly be explored would be coming of age stories, and explorations of mental health and neurodivergency. For these, I\u2019d like to use Sally Rooney, Kiran Desai, and Mark Haddon as examples. The entire paper must be between 2 and 4 pages in length and presented in a scholarly tone. It should be written in a way that addresses an audience already knowledgeable of these authors and the current literary scene and should speak favorably about the state of the literary arts in 2025. It must conclude with a question to the reader as to whether these trends can continue in the new political climate of the United States and the UK, or if the next generation of authors must consider tackling different themes reflecting different times. \r\nAuthor\u2019s works cited should be done in Chicago-style format (Author Lastname, Firstname. Book Title. Publication City: Publisher, Publication date.) and the titles for each work should in bold the first time they are referenced. Near the end of the essay, I would like a suggested reading list, formatted with bullet points and just Author, Title, Publication Year (for this section only). These can be from the authors mentioned or other authors who have exemplified \u201cown voice\u201d in their work. (Bonus if the works also touch on coming of age and mental health). These bullet points should be listed in alphabetical order by author\u2019s last name. \u2028Additional formatting instructions: Any numbers that are not dates should be spelled out (one, two) instead of using Arabic numerals. New paragraphs should be indented with the first letter of that paragraph in bold (as might be seen in a magazine layout). When referencing the \u201cnew political\u201d climate in the US and UK, actual political figures or movements (ie, Trump, Brexit) should not be referenced; rather, a general inclination toward more conservative values should be the focus. And while the overall tone of the essay should be professional and scholarly, I\u2019d still like there to be a little bit of humor in there. A jocular reference to Dan Brown reference to change with the times, should be included organically within the essay.

We are currently struggling to keep up with customer updates. We typically inform customers that if their repairs are expected to take 7 days or less, we will update them every two days, even if it is just to let them know we are still on schedule for the estimated completion date. If repairs are expected to take 8-14 days, we let them know we will update them every 3 days. If repairs are expected to take more than 14 days we let them know we will update them weekly. The formula for calculating length of repair (LOR) is: Total Labor Hours \u00d7 0.3 = LOR (days, rounded up to the next whole number). For example, if the total labor hours are 11.6 (11.6 \u00d7 0.3 = 3.48), the LOR would be 4 days. \r\n\r\nNow, what I need you to do is, for new jobs being dropped off today, I need you to write the update schedule.

We currently have 6 members of staff: Daria (me), Ffion, Gavin, Helen, Jake, and Kasey. Myself, Ffion and Gavin are senior staff members and Gavin's final work day is Thursday next week before he starts his new job. I interviewed the new hire, Luke, last week and he says the first day he can start working is Tuesday because he has to serve his notice period at his current job. I want to train up Jake to be the new senior staff member, and obviously Luke needs to be trained from scratch to become a junior staff member.

The only double shift someone can work is the 10:00-16:00 and 17:00-22:00 combination as these times don't overlap. The problem is, I need to train Jake on how to use the commercial meat slicer before Gavin leaves on Thursday and we only have time to do that in the evenings. Luke needs 3 training shifts from 13:00-16:00 before he can be put on any regular opening shifts, so these training shifts should be additional to the standard daily shifts. Someone senior should oversee these training shifts. Luke shouldn't be put on any closing shifts yet.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem is that we have meat-slicing prep tasks that are done every single day of the week in a closing shift, and only senior members of staff are trained to use the industrial slicer.

{"task_id": "9554be64-5873-417c-936b-ea34af81a67f", "prompt": "I have been tasked with creating an on-boarding program for my warehouse job. \r\n\r\nAt first, I thought it would be just a few teaching a few things, such as how to properly lift furniture (I work at an online furniture retailer), but they want so much more than that. They want a weeklong training program essentially. I have most of the basic requirements: breaks, lifting, scanning, onboarding, etc. Could you help me create a schedule for that? \r\n\r\nI'll note that the company is open Mon-Fri, so each of those days should be present. Also, the timing is 6:00 to 2:30 (with a lunch at 10-10:30). Breaks are 15 minutes and they are around 8 and 12. This doesn't have to be exact but lunch should be.\r\n\r\nMonday: Needs to cover onboarding - signing waivers, all that paperwork, as well as emergency contact, photo for ID badge, etc. (If you can think of anything else, please put it down, and I can clear it or not). A tour is probably going to happen before they are hired, but you can put that here anyway.\r\n\r\nTuesday:  If someone has prior Equipment Operating experience (denoted by EO), this day will be special for them, as we will go over SOP for that. Charging station tour, how to use, sign out sheet (this must be done before a piece of equipment is used). They will need to be evaluated/taught how to use the equipment. For not EO's, they will be shown how to use a hand truck/dolly and/or pallet jacks whatever you want to call it. This includes safety, using gloves, asking for help if the item is heavy, etc. Transporting items will need to be done safely as well as securely. Employee safety is a priority, but we do not want damaged good either. If this seems like a good place to teach proper lifting technique, then put that training here. \r\n\r\nWednesday: This day will be dedicated to lifting/stacking materials in trucks. Each door bay has a light, fan, and stairs to help with lifting items and placing them above others. Explain safety for all of that. After this is shown properly, make sure each person demonstrates a proper lifting (also do this for Tuesday too). \r\n\r\nThursday: SCANNING! Scanning is a huge part of our warehouse. Things are constantly getting miss scanned. Explain that there is a receiving function, placing/staging function (this can be in front of a door or in an aisle), and then a door function (when a product is actually inside a truck). Improper scanning can lead to discipline including write ups, and eventually dismissal if constant errors are made. this needs to be made clear. To pick something up, a worker will scan the PO (purchase order), and now it is on their forks. They will either then place the item in front of a door, placing it in a logical place or inside the truck. Stacking must be done efficiently and safely. \r\n\r\nFriday: Discuss UPH (units per hour). The warehouse expectation is 13 units an hour. This is very doable with the size of our warehouse. We will also need to go over typing up, straps, or load bars. These must be used when items are not secured or at the end of a truck. Each person must demonstrate proper use of these items. \r\n\r\nIs there anything else I need to include? If there is something you think I should add, please insert it inside brackets. Please make each day a heading. Also, bold all of the items to go over.

So I can freestyle if need be.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)[4] is an evergreen conifer species in the pine family, Pinaceae. It is the tallest tree in the Pinaceae family.[5] It is native to western North America and is also known as Douglas-fir,[6] Douglas spruce,[7] Oregon pine,[8] and Columbian pine.[9] There are three varieties: coast Douglas-fir (P. menziesii var. menziesii), Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (P. menziesii var. glauca) and Mexican Douglas-fir (P. menziesii var. lindleyana).[10]\r\n\r\nDespite its common names, it is not a true fir (genus Abies), spruce (genus Picea), or pine (genus Pinus). It is also not a hemlock (genus Tsuga); the genus name Pseudotsuga means \"false hemlock\".\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nDouglas-firs are medium-sized to extremely large evergreen trees, 20\u2013100 metres (70\u2013330 feet) tall (although only coast Douglas-firs reach heights near 100 m)[11] and commonly reach 2.4 m (8 ft) in diameter,[12] although trees with diameters of almost 5 m (16 ft) exist.[13] The largest coast Douglas-firs regularly live over 500 years, with the oldest specimens living for over 1,300 years.[14] Rocky Mountain Douglas-firs, found further to the east,[15] are less long-lived, usually not exceeding 400 years in age.[16]\r\n\r\nThere are records of former coast Douglas-firs exceeding 120 m (390 ft)[17][18] in height, which if alive today would make it the tallest tree species on Earth. Particular historical specimens with heights exceeding 120 m (400 ft) include the Lynn Valley Tree and the Nooksack Giant.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are flat, soft, linear needles 1.5\u20134 cm (1\u20442\u20131+1\u20442 in) long,[19] generally resembling those of the firs, occurring singly rather than in fascicles; they completely encircle the branches, which can be useful in recognizing the species. As the trees grow taller in denser forest, they lose their lower branches, such that the foliage may start as high as 34 m (110 ft) off the ground.[20] Douglas-firs in environments with more light may have branches much closer to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe bark on young trees is thin, smooth, gray, and contains numerous resin blisters. On mature trees, usually exceeding 80 years,[citation needed] it is very thick and corky, growing up to 36 cm (14 in) thick with distinctive, deep vertical fissures caused by the gradual expansion of the growing tree. Some of the mature bark is brown, while other parts are lighter colored with a cork-like texture; these develop in multiple layers.[21] This thick bark makes the Douglas-fir one of the most fire-resistant tree native to the Pacific Northwest.[22]\r\n\r\nThe male cones are yellowish red, 5\u201312 mm (1\u20444\u20131\u20442 in) long. The female cones are green when young, maturing to reddish-brown or gray, 6\u201310 cm (2+1\u20444\u20134 in) long;[19] they are pendulous, with persistent scales, unlike those of true firs. They have distinctive long, trifid (three-pointed) bracts which protrude prominently above each scale and are said to resemble the back half of a mouse, with two feet and a tail.[23] The seeds are 5 mm (1\u20444 in) long, with a longer wing.[19]\r\n\r\nThe massive genome of Douglas-fir was sequenced in 2017 by the large PineRefSeq consortium, revealing a specialized photosynthetic apparatus in the light-harvesting complex of genes.[24]\r\n\r\nMature individual in the Wenatchee Mountains\r\nMature individual in the Wenatchee Mountains\r\nYoung female cone\r\nYoung female cone\r\nMature female cone\r\nMature female cone\r\nTAXONOMY\r\nThe common name honors David Douglas, a Scottish botanist and collector who first reported the extraordinary nature and potential of the species. The common name is misleading since it is not a true fir, i.e., not a member of the genus Abies. For this reason, the name is often written as Douglas-fir (a name also used for the genus Pseudotsuga as a whole). Douglas' connection to the Douglas fir is told in the 1962 Death Valley Days episode 'Grass Man'.[15][25]\r\n\r\nThe specific epithet menziesii is after Archibald Menzies, a Scottish physician and rival naturalist to David Douglas. Menzies first documented the tree on Vancouver Island in 1791. Colloquially, the species is also known simply as Doug fir[9] or Douglas pine[9] (although the latter common name may also refer to Pinus douglasiana).[26] Other names for this tree have included Oregon pine,[8] British Columbian pine,[9] Puget Sound pine,[9] Douglas spruce,[9] false hemlock,[8] red fir,[8] or red pine[8] (although again red pine may refer to a different tree species, Pinus resinosa, and red fir may refer to Abies magnifica).[27]\r\n\r\nOne Coast Salish name for the tree, used in the Halkomelem language, is l\u00e1:yelhp.[28] In the Lushootseed language, the tree is called \u010d\u0259bidac.[29]\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION\r\nPseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii, the coast Douglas-fir, grows in the coastal regions from west-central British Columbia southward to Central California. In Oregon and Washington, its range is continuous from the eastern edge of the Cascades west to the Pacific Coast Ranges and Pacific Ocean. In California, it is found in the Klamath and California Coast Ranges as far south as the Santa Lucia Range, with a small stand as far south as the Purisima Hills in Santa Barbara County.[30][31] One of the last remaining old growth stands of conifers is in the Mattole Watershed, and is under threat of logging.[32][33] In the Sierra Nevada, it ranges as far south as the Yosemite region. It occurs from sea level along the coast to elevations of 1,500 m (4,900 ft) or higher, and inland in some cases up to 2,100 m (6,900 ft).[15]\r\n\r\nAnother variety exists further inland, Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca, the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir or interior Douglas-fir. Interior Douglas-fir intergrades with coast Douglas-fir in the Cascades of northern Washington and southern British Columbia, and from there ranges northward to central British Columbia and southeastward to the Mexican border, becoming increasingly disjunct as latitude decreases and altitude increases. Mexican Douglas-fir (P. lindleyana), which ranges as far south as Oaxaca, is often considered a variety of P. menziesii.\r\n\r\nFossils (wood, pollen) of Pseudotsuga are recorded from the Miocene and Pliocene of Europe (Siebengebirge, Gleiwitz, Austria).[34]\r\n\r\nIt is also naturalised throughout Europe,[35] Argentina and Chile (called Pino Oreg\u00f3n). In New Zealand it is considered to be an invasive species, called a wilding conifer, and is subject to control measures. But is also one of the most common lumber trees used in forestry alongside Radiata pine with large plantations throughout the country. The species was introduced in the 20th century for its wood.[36][37]\r\n\r\nECOLOGY\r\nPreferred sites\r\nDouglas-fir prefers acidic or neutral soils, such as Olympic soil.[38] However, it exhibits considerable morphological plasticity, and on drier sites P. menziesii var. menziesii will generate deeper taproots. Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca exhibits even greater plasticity, occurring in stands of interior temperate rainforest in British Columbia, as well as at the edge of semi-arid sagebrush steppe throughout much of its range, where it generates even deeper taproots still.\r\n\r\nThe coast Douglas-fir variety is the dominant tree west of the Cascade Mountains in the Pacific Northwest. It occurs in nearly all forest types and competes well on most parent materials, aspects, and slopes. Adapted to a more moist, mild climate than the interior subspecies, it grows larger and faster than Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. Associated trees include western hemlock, Sitka spruce, sugar pine, western white pine, ponderosa pine, grand fir, coast redwood, western redcedar, California incense-cedar, Lawson's cypress, tanoak, bigleaf maple and several others. Pure stands are also common, particularly north of the Umpqua River in Oregon. It is most dominant in areas with a more frequent fire regime that suppresses less fire-resistant conifers.[21]\r\n\r\nUse by animals\r\n\r\nA snag provides nest cavities for birds.\r\nDouglas-fir seeds are an extremely important food source for small mammals such as moles, shrews, and chipmunks, which consume an estimated 65% of each annual seed crop. The Douglas squirrel harvests and hoards great quantities of Douglas-fir cones, and also consumes mature pollen cones, the inner bark, terminal shoots, and developing young needles.[14]\r\n\r\nMature or \"old-growth\" Douglas-fir forest is the primary habitat of the red tree vole (Arborimus longicaudus) and the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). Home range requirements for breeding pairs of spotted owls are at least 400 hectares (4.0 km2; 990 acres) of old growth. Red tree voles may also be found in immature forests if Douglas-fir is a significant component. The red vole nests almost exclusively in the foliage of the trees, typically 2\u201350 metres (5\u2013165 ft) above the ground, and its diet consists chiefly of Douglas-fir needles.[14]\r\n\r\nDouglas-fir needles are generally poor browse for ungulates, although in the winter when other food sources are lacking it can become important, and black-tailed deer browse new seedlings and saplings in spring and summer. The spring diet of the blue grouse features Douglas-fir needles prominently.[14]\r\n\r\nThe leaves are also used by the woolly conifer aphid Adelges cooleyi; this 0.5 mm-long sap-sucking insect is conspicuous on the undersides of the leaves by the small white \"fluff spots\" of protective wax that it produces. It is often present in large numbers, and can cause the foliage to turn yellowish from the damage it causes. Exceptionally, trees may be partially defoliated by it, but the damage is rarely this severe. Among Lepidoptera, apart from some that feed on Pseudotsuga in general, the gelechiid moths Chionodes abella and C. periculella as well as the cone scale-eating tortrix moth Cydia illutana have been recorded specifically on P. menziesii.\r\n\r\nThe inner bark is the primary winter food for the North American porcupine.[14]\r\n\r\nPoriol is a flavanone, a type of flavonoid, produced by P. menziesii in reaction to infection by Poria weirii.[39]\r\n\r\nValue to other plants\r\nA parasitic plant which uses P. menziesii is the Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium douglasii). Epiphytes such as crustose lichens and mosses are common sights on Douglas-firs.[21] As it is only moderately shade tolerant,[15] undisturbed Douglas-fir stands in humid areas will eventually give way to later successional, more shade-tolerant associates such as the western redcedar and western hemlock\u2014though this process may take a thousand years or more.[14] It is more shade tolerant than some associated fire-dependent species, such as western larch and ponderosa pine, and often replaces these species further inland.[15]\r\n\r\nDiseases and insects\r\nFungal diseases such as laminated root rot and shoestring root-rot can cause significant damage, and in plantation settings dominated by Douglas-fir monocultures may cause extreme damage to vast swathes of trees.[14] Interplanting with resistant or nonhost species such as western redcedar and beaked hazelnut[40] can reduce this risk. Other threats to Douglas-fir include red ring rot and the Douglas-fir beetle.[14]\r\n\r\nUses\r\n\r\nA 2.7 m (9 ft) log, scaling over 7,000 board feet (16,5 cubic meters) of timber, c. 1937\r\nMany different Native American groups used the bark, resin, and needles to make herbal treatments for various diseases.[41] Native Hawaiians built wa\u02bba kaulua (double-hulled canoes) from coast Douglas-fir logs that had drifted ashore.[42] The wood has historically been favored as firewood, especially from the coastal variety.[15] In addition early settlers used Douglas-fir for all forms of building construction, including floors, beams, and fine carving.\r\n\r\nThe species is extensively used in forestry management as a plantation tree for softwood timber. Douglas-fir is one of the world's best timber-producing species and yields more timber than any other species in North America, making the forestlands of western Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia the most productive on the continent. In 2011, Douglas-fir represented 34.2% of US lumber exports, to a total of 1.053 billion board feet (2,484,803,3 cubic meters).[43][14] Douglas-fir timber is used for timber frame construction and timber trusses using traditional joinery, veneer, and flooring due to its strength, hardness and durability.[44] As of 2024, the only wooden ships still currently in use by the U.S. Navy in conventional naval operations are Avenger-class minesweepers, made of Douglas-fir.[45]\r\n\r\nDouglas-fir sees wide use in heavy timber structures, as its wood is strong, available in a number of specifications including kiln dried and grade stamped, and can be supplied in very long lengths to 18 m (60 ft). West coast mills are sophisticated in their processing of timbers, making lead times predictable and availability reliable. Paints adhere well to Douglas-fir. Stains perform well on Douglas-fir timbers with the mild caution that the natural color of this species varies and care must be taken to ensure uniformity of color. Pitch pockets that may ooze resin can be present in timbers that have not been kiln dried. Because of the timber sizes available, stamped timber grading, and relatively short lead times, Douglas-fir sees wide use in both public and residential projects.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nThe species has ornamental value in large parks and gardens.[46] It has been commonly used as a Christmas tree since the 1920s, and the trees are typically grown on plantations.[47]\r\n\r\nThe buds have been used to flavor eau de vie, a clear, colorless fruit brandy.[48] Douglas-fir pine leaves can be used to make pine needle tea.[49] They possess a tangy citrus flavor and may serve in some recipes as a wild substitute for rosemary.[50]", "rubrics": ["The first paragraph of the response should only take from the fourth section on ecology.

I've got this book I can't seem to remember to use, but it has sections for monthly goals, a calendar to track bills and whatnot, some sort of checklist I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with, and a few pages to track expenses. This is a part I struggle with. I don't keep a daily track of my expenses, but I do have credit card statements I could pull and upload if there's an easy way to connect them to the system. Also, I don't want to have to repopulate all this information for each month, so everything needs to be dynamic, with all the data connecting in the most efficient way. \r\n\r\nWith all that said, first, can you give me a couple of layout ideas and the important categories to include, such as, but not limited to: Financial Goals, Monthly Objectives, Long-Term Plan, Debt Repayment Schedule, fixed and variable expenses tables with areas for like, subscriptions or projected groceries, a dynamic calendar that updates each month, and somewhere to track daily/weekly income and expenses. I'm looking for what should be on the screen first, ya know, like I should remind myself of what goal I'm aiming towards, or what reward is linked to this financial goal, because I don't want to pull up the document and immediately see the \"total debt\" in big red letters staring me in the face. And since this is in Excel, the goals can be in the top left, with the calendar to the right or underneath, or an expense tracker on the far right of the same sheet for simple formulas, or in a new sheet for better aesthetic formatting. Layout suggestions like that, because I can scroll around the sheet, and I think this will be a pretty big running document.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of layout suggestions, the real fun begins. I need a step-by-step method of how to create a dynamic calendar table. I believe I can set up formulas to populate a basic table with the correct date for each day of the week, so it matches the current year and weekly schedule, and I can just copy and paste for each new month. I also want to be able to take notes here, so would it be cool to have a dropdown menu to change the day's color, or some sort of conditional formatting that shows if a bill is due on that day, or like green for when I'm supposed to track my income each week? Don't worry about any formulas for this section aside from creating the basic dynamic calendar, but with the idea of dropdown menus, include a few suggestions for other enhancements for this calendar that would be helpful to include as part of a dynamic budget, such as having a cell at the end of the week that calculates total income-expenses or something.\r\n\r\nAlso, how do I simply upload an exported credit card statement, and connect whatever charges show up to a more organized expense report from multiple statements into a long list of each charge, but that also condenses this information in another, more compact table that pulls the monthly charges or potentially even separates the numbers by which report they came from? I don't know, this area I need suggestions with, because what are my options to simplify these expense reports in a way that I don't have to manually transfer all of this information, and can offload the stress of tracking my expenses on a weekly basis, that also adheres to the logic of Excel. Include whatever pertinent options Excel offers for this, but provide only a brief elaboration on the formula and how difficult the process would be, without going into a step-by-step explanation just yet.\r\n\r\nFinally, are there any areas of a personal budget that I should include? Any specific graphs, pivot tables, or other methods of formatting, whether useful or aesthetic, that I should consider including in this budget to make my life easier?", "rubrics": ["The response should provide at least two suggestions for a financial budget layout within Microsoft Excel.", "The response should include suggestions for categories to include within a personal financial budget.

{"task_id": "a675a2c6-740e-4ded-9438-b1e886ef5e4b", "prompt": "LESSON MAKER PRO:\r\n\r\nSometimes I don\u2019t have enough time to create new lesson plans and quizzes for my weekly online English class, so if you could help me, that would be great! I\u2019ll tell you what I typically want, enter that week's data, and you\u2019ll be able to spit something out for me and save me a bunch of time. By the way, my students are around 12 or 13 years old, and English is their second language (after Mandarin), so please keep all explanations and instructions simple so they can understand.  \r\n\r\nEach of my lessons usually consists of four components:\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION: \r\n\r\nFirst, I introduce a new topic to my students, often a new grammar rule or vocabulary exercise. This section will also have the title of the day\u2019s learning goals, so make sure to include that. \r\n\r\nIf it\u2019s a grammar day - I like to start simple by breaking down the grammar rule into its simplest form, with a few (2 or 3) concrete examples that my students can relate to or understand. If a few of my examples are about Taiwan, my students seem to pay more attention, so please strive for this in about 20% of your examples throughout. The most important thing here is teaching the students WHY, WHEN, and HOW to use this particular grammar rule, so please break this down clearly, with each of those question words as a mini-section with a short but meaningful explanation for each. \r\n\r\nIf it\u2019s a vocabulary day, I always stick to a theme for the lesson, whether that\u2019s a real-world theme (like the ocean, for example) or a phonetic theme (like words that use \u201cgh\u201d together). Since these kids are relatively new learners of English, let\u2019s keep the words fun and non-scientific (think sharks and seaweed instead of salinity or acidification). Our vocabulary list will be ten words long, and each word should include a simple sentence using the word correctly. If a word is a plural form, or a verb conjugation, there should be a note about that as well so the students understand that this is not the base form of the word. But these instances shouldn\u2019t account for more than 10% of total words (1 out of 10). \r\n\r\n EXAMPLES: \r\n\r\nThis section is about real-world applications of either the new grammar rule or the new vocabulary words. Essentially, this section will be a sample paragraph that either utilizes the new grammar rule 3 or 4 times or, if we\u2019re doing vocabulary, the paragraph will include all 10 words naturally. These paragraphs should include at least one reference to Taiwan or Taiwanese culture. I will break down this paragraph to show students the new rules or words being utilized, and have them read it aloud as well. \r\n\r\nQUIZ: \r\n\r\nLastly, once we have become familiar with the new concepts, I will quiz the students on what they have learned (always ten questions in a numbered list). My quizzes are either multiple-choice for grammar rules, with a clear indication of the words/phrases they can use for their answers (A, B, C, or D), or fill-in-the-blank for vocabulary (with a corresponding list of words they can choose from).  \r\n\r\nFor grammar, the quiz must test the students' understanding of the new concept. If they\u2019re learning verb conjugation, there must be multiple forms of the verb being tested in the possible answer section (walk or walks vs walked, for example). \r\n\r\nFor vocabulary, each question would correspond to one of the new words we learned, testing their ability to understand the sentence and enter the correct word. The answer key list will show all ten words. \r\n\r\nThe quiz should include rules at the top explaining what students are supposed to do. Please leave a blank space or underline where the answer will go in the question. The vocabulary list should be scrambled, so that the answer for question one would not necessarily be the first word on the answer key list. For grammar, please randomize the correct answer (so that not every answer is A, for example). \r\n\r\nFOR TEACHER (on a separate page):\r\n\r\nThe last section will be an answer key for the quiz that I can print out to help me with grading. I need you to bold the correct multiple choice answer for easy reading, and input the correct answer in bold in the question, and the vocabulary questions should have the correct word inputted in bold in the blank space. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s it, so every time I need a new lesson I can input it below here:\r\n\r\nLesson 2: In the garden!\r\n\r\nGoal: Help students learn new garden-themed vocabulary words!

They've learned the multiplication chart from the 0s to the 12s, so they should be able to multiply any number 0-12 by another number 0-12.\r\n\r\nI'd like the test to be made up of a table with 5 columns and 12 rows. Each cell in the table will contain one multiplication question that fits the class' level. First, each cell should be numbered going across horizontally first, and then continued on the next row. Then I need each cell to have the multiplication question, but I want the numbers in each question not to be a repeat of the question that comes before or after. For example, if question 2 is 7\u00d73=, then questions 1 and 3 should not have 7 or 3 in the question. This way, the numbers are mixed up, and the students will operate more from memory, instead of using addition in their heads or anything like that. It's supposed to be memorized.\r\n\r\nAbove that, I would like a large-text title, followed by instructions. The instructions should be 1-3 sentences that explain to my students how to set up their page. I want them to fold their paper in half to create a crease down the middle of the page. Open it back up and number each line vertically, then continue next to the crease, then on the back. They should put the question number, followed by the equation, then the answer on their page. Their name the the math test title should go at the top. Explain this in a way that the class can understand and follow the instructions. They will have 10 minutes; make sure that's in the instructions too. Make sure the instructions, question numbers, and questions are in plain text.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the table with the questions, I needed the table repeated, but I need the answers included. It should match the first table exactly, but it should include the answers bolded.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that I will show the questions on the projection screen, and they will take their test on a separate sheet of paper.

Our company name is \"The Puzzle People\" and every holiday we run a campaign to raise money for the needy. This year we are fundraising for The Trevor Project. The campaign will be six word puzzles.

Once someone has the answers to all 6 puzzles they will have one final puzzle to conclude the campaign.

I plan to have a few macros that paste pre-written, professional responses for certain IT tickets so I am not typing out the same things all the time. \r\n\r\nFor one, I need a response that I can add at the end of the ticket interaction. It needs to inform the user that since their issues have been resolved, that the ticket will be moved into the Resolved state. The user has 48 hours to reply to the ticket to re-open it otherwise they will need to open a new ticket by emailing support@itadventures.com or calling 636-555-1234. \r\n\r\nAnother will need to inform the user that due to several attempts to reach them, that their ticket will be moved to a Closed status. Tell them the same how to open a new ticket by emailing or calling the support number from the end of the previous response. \r\n\r\nAnother should inform the user that their ticket does not fall into the scope of IT, but their ticket will be transferred to the correct department. Instead of making it generic, use <Insert Dept> in place of the \"correct\" in correct dept. This will make it easier for me to see it and fill in the relevant dept before sending the ticket off. Just to make sure I don't forget, add \" ########## REPLACE DEPT NAME ##########\" above and below this response so when it pastes into the email reply box, I have to quickly highlight and delete these to ensure I don't forget to enter the relevant dept. \r\n\r\nLast, I need a professional way to ask the user to restart their computer then let me know if they still have the issue. If I don't hear anything back after 48 hours, I'll move the ticket to Resolved which you should use the same ending as previous regarding the Resolved tickets closing and the user being able to re-open it. Ostensibly, I'm giving them 4 days to reply after restarting their computer. \r\n\r\nPlease, bold the instances of support email, phone number, and ticket statuses (Resolved, Open, Closed) throughout the responses.

The event is from 10 AM to 2 PM, with an additional slot to serve from 8 AM to 10 AM for setup. All of our volunteers have signed up for a two-hour shift (at a minimum) or more.\r\n\r\nI need to place each volunteer in a role that suits them best without short-changing any station. So, every station needs the required number of volunteers. We should give each volunteer their preference of serving location, unless doing so would place too many volunteers at one station or not enough in another station. In that case, volunteers should be placed anywhere else EXCEPT a location that they specifically requested NOT to be placed at.\r\n\r\nA couple of special exceptions: the Christmas Carol station MUST be exactly who I\u2019ve specified in the volunteer list. These CANNOT be moved to another station. The same goes for the Photo Booth. Charlene is our volunteer for that station - that CANNOT change. This is also true of the \u201cCharacters\u201d station, the Story of Christmas Station, and the Social Media Team: volunteers must be EXACTLY who I\u2019ve specified in the volunteer list. For these stations, they can have more than the required number of volunteers, seeing as they are specialized teams.\r\n\r\nIf the volunteer has signed up for an all-day commitment, they should stay at their station for the entire event. However, if the volunteer is only scheduled for a shift, they must be replaced.\r\n\r\nPlease create a volunteer layout in the following format. If you could please use bolding for the station numbers/titles, and a header for the shift label, that would really help me organize this well.\r\n\r\nSETUP SHIFT: 8 AM - 10 AM\r\nVOLUNTEER 1:\r\nVOLUNTEER 2:\r\nVOLUNTEER 3:\r\netc\u2026\r\n\r\nSHIFT 1: 10 AM - 12 PM\r\nSTATION #: TITLE\r\nVOLUNTEER 1:\r\nVOLUNTEER 2:\r\nVOLUNTEER 3:\r\netc\u2026\r\n\r\nSHIFT 2: 12 PM - 2 PM\r\nSTATION #: TITLE\r\nVOLUNTEER 1:\r\nVOLUNTEER 2:\r\nVOLUNTEER 3:\r\netc\u2026\r\n\r\nI have two lists for you below. One is a list of stations and their names, as well as how many volunteers we need at that station. We need that number of volunteers present for the entire day - so even as shifts change, we must have that number of volunteers present at those stations at all times. If we have a surplus of volunteers (more than enough to fill every role during that shift), then we can have more volunteers than required.\r\n\r\nThe second list is a list of all the volunteers that we have signed up. This second list contains their preferences regarding where they want to or don\u2019t want to serve, and what shift they have signed up for. If I have them listed as \u201cALL DAY,\u201d they are available for all three shifts (SETUP, SHIFT 1, SHIFT 2). \r\n\r\nIf we do not have enough volunteers for any station and/or portion of the day, please tell me how many volunteers we are lacking and where, as well as for which shift. Also, let me know how many people are planning to be there for the set up shift.\r\n\r\nWe also need one person labeled as a FLOATER. This person doesn't go in any station, but they are on hand for bathroom breaks, etc.\r\n\r\nLastly, in a separate section at the end, please draft me up a quick email.

I want to take the novel Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston, and analyze it in relation to a more contemporary work which isn't in the realm of literature. I was thinking that it would go along well with an August Wilson play. You're going to help me brainstorm different ways I can go about doing this.\r\n\r\nTake a look at this excerpt from the opening of Their Eyes Were Watching God:\r\n\r\n\"Ships at a distance have every man\u2019s wish on board. For some they\r\ncome in with the tide. For others they sail forever on the horizon, nev-\r\ner out of sight, never landing until the Watcher turns his eyes away in\r\nresignation, his dreams mocked to death by Time. That is the life of\r\nmen.\r\nNow, women forget all those things they don\u2019t want to remember,\r\nand remember everything they don\u2019t want to forget. The dream is the\r\ntruth. Then they act and do things accordingly.\r\nSo the beginning of this was a woman and she had come back from\r\nburying the dead. Not the dead of sick and ailing with friends at the\r\npillow and the feet. She had come back from the sodden and the\r\nbloated; the sudden dead, their eyes flung wide open in judgment.\r\nThe people all saw her come because it was sundown. The sun was\r\ngone, but he had left his footprints in the sky. It was the time for sit-\r\nting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and\r\ntalk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences\r\nall day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But\r\nnow, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful\r\nand human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They\r\npassed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment.\r\nSeeing the woman as she was made them remember the envy they\r\nhad stored up from other times. So they chewed up the back parts of\r\ntheir minds and swallowed with relish. They made burning statements\r\nwith questions, and killing tools out of laughs. It was mass cruelty. A\r\nmood come alive. Words walking without masters; walking altogether\r\nlike harmony in a song.\"\r\n\r\nIdentify how gendered language is used (and where it explicitly isn't used in relation to describing people) in this section using a numbered list. Then, I want you to come up with the first half of the thesis that I'll be using for this project. It should have something to do with the use of gendered language in this excerpt along with the theme of community, social life, and race. For each instance of your numbered list, write a sentence in a summary paragraph that describes your initial thesis more in depth and in relation to what you identified.\r\n\r\nAfter that, select three August Wilson plays that I could potentially use in comparison to the novel. Each should have its own header with the title of the play in italics and the year it was written. Under that, use a few bullet points to highlight the main features of the play that relate and resonate to the themes of the novel / the thesis you've put forth. Then, based on these points, provide a revised thesis that takes elements from the original and puts them in dialogue with the Wilson play you've selected. Each revised thesis should mention both the title of the novel and the play you're comparing it to. Proceeding from that, each section should end with a few explicitly stated themes (in bold) that a comparison of the two works reveal, along with an explanation of where your comparison is coming from.\r\n\r\nEnd with a conclusion paragraph (separated by a header) that sums up the major themes covered in the Wilson plays and how they can directly connect with the information provided in the excerpt I've included at the beginning of this prompt.", "rubrics": ["The response should identify in a numbered list where gendered language is and isn't used in the provided text.

ELLIS\r\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\r\nMR. ELLIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\r\nit please the Court:\r\nThe Fourth Circuit's automatic vacatur\r\nrule for forfeited Rehaif plea colloquy errors\r\nis flatly inconsistent with this Court's\r\nrepeated recognition that even the most\r\nfundamental rights can be forfeited and that a\r\ncourt of appeals should recognize a forfeited\r\nclaim only on a case-by-case basis in\r\nexceptional circumstances.\r\nThe Court should reverse for two\r\nprincipal reasons. First, Rehaif errors are not\r\nautomatically or even generally prejudicial.\r\nBeing convicted of a felony is not the sort of\r\nlife event that one is ordinarily unaware of or\r\nforgets. In the mine-run of cases, as it is\r\nhere, it would be implausible that a defendant\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nwho pleaded guilty to possessing a gun as a\r\nfelon would have insisted on going to trial if\r\nhe'd only known that the government would have\r\nto prove that he knew he was -- had previously\r\nbeen convicted of such a serious crime.\r\nAnd, second, there's no exception from\r\nplain-error review for claims that were\r\nforeclosed by circuit precedent at the time of\r\nthe district court's proceeding. This Court's\r\ndecisions in Puckett and Johnson rightly\r\nrecognize that the Court lacks authority to\r\ncreate such an atextual exception out of whole\r\ncloth, and those holdings equally apply here.\r\nPlain-error review is not an absolute\r\nbar to relief. As demonstrated by the\r\nexperience of every other court of appeals in\r\nthe wake of this Court's decision in Rehaif,\r\ncourts can and should grant relief under that\r\nstandard in cases where a Rehaif error has truly\r\nworked an injustice.\r\nThe Fourth Circuit's per se rule would\r\nthus only serve to undermine the careful balance\r\nbetween judicial efficiency and fairness\r\nestablished by the Federal Rules and to provide\r\na windfall to defendants like Respondent, whose\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nconvictions were and remain fundamentally fair.\r\nThe Court should reverse the decision\r\nbelow, hold that forfeited Rehaif plea colloquy\r\nclaims are subject to the same case-specific\r\nplain-error review as any other forfeited claim,\r\nand make clear that Respondent cannot make that\r\nshowing.\r\nI welcome the Court's questions.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Ellis,\r\nunder the government's theory, does it matter\r\nwhich element a district court omits during the\r\nplea colloquy, or does the omission of an\r\nelement never constitute structural error?\r\nMR. ELLIS: We don't think the\r\nomission of an element ever constitutes\r\nstructural error. And we don't think that --\r\nthat any omission of an element would -- would\r\nwarrant a per se approach to plain-error review.\r\nWe think the Court's decision in Henderson v.\r\nMorgan and Bousley are pretty -- are instructive\r\non that point.\r\nNow the -- the nature of the element\r\nmight -- would inform both the prong 3 analysis\r\nas to whether the defendant can show prejudice\r\nand per se -- and the prong 4 analysis, so we\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\ndon't think it justifies a -- a per se rule.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if a judge\r\n-- a district court advises the defendant during\r\nthe plea colloquy that murder is a strict\r\nliability offense and, you know, it doesn't\r\nmatter whether he has the intent to kill or not,\r\nyou think that -- you don't have a per se rule\r\nthere, in a situation like that, that that would\r\nbe structural error?\r\nMR. ELLIS: No, Your Honor, we don't\r\nthink that would be structural error. I think\r\nthat is pretty analogous actually to the -- the\r\nfacts at issue in the Henderson v. Morgan case,\r\nwhere the defendant -- the court didn't inform\r\nthe -- the -- the defendant that he had to have\r\nthe intent to kill for a second-degree murder\r\nconviction. And even there, the court didn't\r\ngrant relief without noting that it was --\r\ncouldn't be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nThe structural errors are -- are a\r\nlimited class, and they are those errors that\r\nreally go to the overall structure of the\r\nproceeding and not a discrete error within it.\r\nAnd that includes -- serious errors don't\r\nqualify as structural errors. That doesn't mean\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\na defendant can't show prejudice on a\r\ncase-specific basis, but it does mean that --\r\nthat it should be required to do so.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it's\r\njust not one element but two elements, three\r\nelements? Does it matter?\r\nMR. ELLIS: So, you know --\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no --\r\nno structural error if, you know, there are four\r\nelements of the offense and the judge leaves out\r\nthree of them?\r\nMR. ELLIS: So, you know, this Court's\r\ndecision in Dominguez Benitez at Footnote 10\r\nsuggests that there might be some structural\r\nerrors in the plea colloquy context. It pointed\r\nthere to the decision in Boykin v. Alabama. You\r\nknow, that -- that's pretty far afield of what\r\nwe have here. It's not even just an element\r\nproblem.\r\nIn that case, the defendant pleaded\r\nguilty without being asked a single question\r\nabout the nature -- to make sure he understood\r\nthe nature of the charges or the consequences or\r\nthe rights he was giving up. We do think, you\r\nknow, that -- that that might rise to a\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nstructural error.\r\nSomething short of that, you know,\r\nit's going to be a harder case than the one\r\nhere. I think the Court grappled with the same\r\nsort of problem in Neder, where Justice Scalia\r\nmade a similar argument in dissent. And what\r\nthe Court said there was, you know, we're --\r\nwe're not going to go take this \"penny in for a\r\npenny in per pound\" approach. We're not going\r\nto categorize all element errors as structural\r\nerrors just because there might be hard cases at\r\nthe margins.\r\nAnd the last thing I'd say about that\r\nis we haven't seen cases that sort of press that\r\nline to date, and I think there's good reason\r\nfor that. As you get more and more egregious\r\nerrors, it's just not going to matter if you\r\nlabel it structural or not. A defendant's going\r\nto be able to show -- make a prejudice showing.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\r\ncounsel.\r\nJustice Thomas.\r\nJUSTICE THOMAS: Thank you, Mr. Chief\r\nJustice.\r\nCounsel, would you briefly comment on\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nRespondent's harmless-error review approach to\r\nthis case?\r\nMR. ELLIS: So I think you're --\r\nyou're referring to the Respondent's argument\r\nthat he shouldn't have to satisfy plain-error\r\nreview?\r\nJUSTICE THOMAS: Yeah.\r\nMR. ELLIS: So that is obviously an\r\nissue that he didn't raise below and is raising\r\nfor the first point -- first time here. We\r\nthink the Court has discretion to reach it, and\r\nwe -- we think it's flatly contrary to the\r\nCourt's decision in Johnson.\r\nThe Court in Johnson and Puckett\r\nrecognized both that the Court doesn't have\r\nauthority to create exceptions to the text of\r\n52(b), and the text of 52(b) doesn't admit of\r\nany exception for a futile exception. In\r\nJohnson, the Court -- there was near universal\r\ncircuit precedent against the decision at the\r\ntime when the error was waived, and still the\r\nCourt subjected it to -- to plain-error review.\r\nThe way it --\r\nJUSTICE THOMAS: I --\r\nMR. ELLIS: -- accounted for that in\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n-- in Johnson was, at the second prong of\r\nplain-error review, it said that the -- the\r\nCourt's going to analyze the plainness of the\r\nerror based on the -- the law at the time of\r\nappeal. And that means that even in a -- in a\r\n-- in a circumstance like that, where you\r\nforfeited a claim that was barred by circuit\r\nprecedent, you can still get relief under\r\nplain-error review. You just have to satisfy\r\nthe third and fourth prongs.\r\nWe think that's the right -- the\r\nbalance, and the Court should reaffirm that\r\napproach here.\r\nJUSTICE THOMAS: Can you think of -- I\r\nmay have missed this in your discussion with the\r\nChief Justice, but can you think of any error\r\nthat would -- would require automatic vacatur\r\nunder plain error?\r\nMR. ELLIS: Under plain error? No,\r\nYour Honor, the Court hasn't identified one.\r\nAnd what it has said repeatedly in Young and in\r\nPuckett is that the -- that a per se approach to\r\nplain error is flawed.\r\nYou know, the -- the -- the -- the\r\nrules of plain error are intended to set up a\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nsystem where you are encouraged and incentivized\r\nto raise your claims in a timely manner and then\r\nprovide a safety valve for courts of appeals to\r\nexercise their discretion to recognize a\r\nforfeited -- a forfeited claim when there has\r\nbeen a showing of prejudice and when there -- it\r\nwould undermine the fairness and integrity of\r\njudicial proceedings not to do so. But we don't\r\nthink there's a per se rule for -- for any type\r\nof error.\r\nJUSTICE THOMAS: Thank you.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice\r\nBreyer.\r\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Thank you very\r\nmuch. I have no questions.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Alito.\r\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we were to rule for\r\nMr. Gary in this case, do you have an estimate\r\nof the number of cases pending in the courts of\r\nappeals or before this Court that would be\r\naffected?\r\nMR. ELLIS: So we -- we noted in our\r\nbrief there's -- there are 80 courses -- cases\r\nbeing held, about 82 cases being held out of the\r\nFourth Circuit, the only circuit to not apply\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nthe normal plain-error standards here, that\r\nwould be affected.\r\nThat's -- obviously, the Court's\r\ndecision would have broader effect across the\r\nboard, and we don't have a -- I can't give you\r\nan estimate of that number of cases.\r\nWhat I -- what I can point out is that\r\n922(g) prosecutions are among the most common in\r\nthe federal system. In 2019, we cited a study\r\non page 42 of our opening brief, there were --\r\nthey accounted for nearly 10 percent or,\r\nactually, I think at least over 10 percent of\r\nall federal prosecutions, that was 7500 cases.\r\nAnd -- and so, you know, the -- the --\r\nGary's rule here was -- would require automatic\r\nvacatur of all those claims in which they're\r\nasserted on direct appeal. I'd also point out\r\nthat, you know, whatever the burden is as a\r\nmatter -- a quantitative matter, qualitatively,\r\nit just doesn't make any sense.\r\nThe other circuits, in the ordinary\r\nprinciples of plain-error review, allow\r\ndefendants who are actually harmed by a Rehaif\r\nerror to get relief under plain-error review.\r\nAnd so, really, the Fourth Circuit's per se rule\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nhas the -- the effect of just catching those\r\ncases where a defendant can't make a plausible\r\nclaim, like this one, that it would have made a\r\ndifference in the proceeding.\r\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the Respondent\r\nsuggests that automatic vacatur in cases like\r\nthis one pose a significant burden on the\r\njudiciary because most defendants will readily\r\nplead guilty again. Is that true?\r\nMR. ELLIS: It's hard to predict what\r\ndefendants will do. I guess the fact that\r\nthey're asserting it on appeal suggests that\r\nthey're not intending to do the exact same thing\r\nthey did the first time, even if, had the error\r\nbeen raised, they would have.\r\nYou know, I -- I think that as far as\r\nconcerns about counsel raising a -- a litany of\r\nfutile objections, I'd say two things. The\r\nfirst is that Johnson already dealt with that.\r\nAs I noted, that very argument was made in\r\nJohnson. The Court agreed that it was a\r\nlegitimate concern but held that the right\r\napproach was to make plain error -- the second\r\nprong of plain error turn on the law at the time\r\nof appeal.\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\nAnd that means that you're not\r\nforeclosed entirely when there's a change of\r\nlaw, but you still have to make a prejudice\r\nshowing. And in the wake of that, we haven't\r\nseen a litany of futile objections being raised.\r\nI think that's good reason.\r\nDefense counsel have -- have all the\r\nincentive to focus on claims that might actually\r\nmake a difference, and they can know that even\r\nfor forfeited claims where there's a change of\r\nlaw, they can -- their client can get relief if\r\nit made -- under plain-error review if it really\r\nmade a difference in working an injustice.\r\nJUSTICE ALITO: Thank you.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice\r\nSotomayor.\r\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, this is a\r\nvery different kind of case than our other\r\nplain-error cases because, in our other cases,\r\nthe defendant had a reason for putting forth a\r\ndefense. So whether it was Neder, the defendant\r\nknew that someone had to find materiality. It\r\nwas the same thing in Johnson.\r\nBut this is the kind of case where no\r\ndefendant knew that there could be an actual\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\ndefense at all. So why wouldn't we find that a\r\nstructural error? You're omitting the\r\nrequirement of an offense at all. And even if\r\nwe found it to be structural error under prong\r\n3, why wouldn't you win under prong 4?\r\nBecause assuming that a court can look\r\nat the entire record under prong 4, here, the\r\ndefendant admitted to the probation officer that\r\nhe -- and to the court, I believe, that he knew\r\nhe was a felon. So don't you win either way?\r\nMR. ELLIS: We do. We agree that we\r\nwin either way. I think Johnson and Cotton make\r\ncrystal clear that even if you decide this kind\r\nof error is a structural error, that it still\r\nhas to satisfy prong 4, and -- and I agree\r\nentirely with the premise of your question, Your\r\nHonor, that the defendant here would lose on\r\nprong 4.\r\nThat said, I -- I don't think it is\r\nright to call this a structural error.\r\nYou know, you alluded to the fact that -- that\r\nthe -- the Respondent's argument that he\r\nwouldn't have an opportunity or incentive to\r\nchallenge the -- the -- the evidence here as to\r\nhis knowledge. I don't think that's just --\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\nthat's accurate as a -- a general matter.\r\nYou know, the evidence we're relying\r\non here is from the PSR in sentencing, his own\r\nstatement, as you point out. You know,\r\ndefendants have --\r\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have --\r\nMR. ELLIS: -- every incentive --\r\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me,\r\ncounsel. Do you have the same answer to the\r\nquestions posed earlier about the defendant who\r\nreally didn't know or have an opportunity to\r\ncreate a record?\r\nDo you agree that we should look at\r\nthose cases, even in a guilty plea, as different\r\nthan in the normal situation that a defendant\r\nshould be able to proffer evidence before the\r\nappellate court?\r\nMR. ELLIS: So we haven't gotten into\r\nthe record questions here. I -- I would say a\r\ncouple things about that.\r\nFirst, we know at least with regard to\r\nthe record before the district court, that's --\r\nthat's entirely open on --\r\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, I'm not --\r\nMR. ELLIS: -- in a case like this --\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I'm not asking\r\nyou that because it never gets back to the\r\ndistrict court unless the appellate court says\r\nthat there was an error that sends the case\r\nback. I'm asking the question as if a defendant\r\ndidn't know and didn't put into the record a\r\nplausible defense.\r\nDo you agree with your colleague in --\r\nin Greer that that defendant could proffer that\r\nin the appellate -- to the appellate court?\r\nMR. ELLIS: Yes, Your Honor. We\r\nhave -- we have no objection to a -- a -- a\r\ndefendant offering that up, proffering that on\r\nthe first instance to a court of appeals in that\r\ninstance.\r\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Thank you,\r\ncounsel.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kagan.\r\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Ellis, when you\r\nwere answering the Chief Justice's hypotheticals\r\nearlier, you said that structural errors really\r\nall go to the overall structure of the\r\nproceeding and that's why none of the\r\nhypotheticals he gave you were, in fact,\r\ninstances of structural error.\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\nBut I had thought that there was a\r\ndifferent category of structural error where\r\nwhat we were looking at was some interest that\r\nwas unrelated to whether there was an erroneous\r\nconviction and, in particular, a category where\r\nwe were concerned with autonomy interests, with\r\nthe ability of a defendant to make his own\r\nchoices.\r\nAnd in some of those hypotheticals\r\nthat the Chief Justice was giving you, I would\r\nhave thought that there was no such ability to\r\nmake your own choices, that you have so little\r\ninformation in cases like that that the autonomy\r\ninterest is raised to a very high level.\r\nSo I'm -- I'm curious as to your\r\nresponse to that.\r\nMR. ELLIS: Sure, Your Honor. So I --\r\nI agree with you that the Court in -- in Weaver\r\nin particular identified as one reason why a\r\ncase -- an error might be a structural one is\r\nthat it protects an error different than the --\r\nthe conviction, and -- and it specifically\r\nflagged autonomy.\r\nI'd say first that, you know, what\r\nWeaver went on to say is that that sort of error\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\nis still not the kind that should remove --\r\nrelieve a defendant of his requirement to show\r\nprejudice and certainly wouldn't go to the\r\nfourth prong.\r\nNow, as to whether this kind of error\r\nis an autonomy -- protects an autonomy interest,\r\nI think -- I think not. I think the Court --\r\nwhere the Court's found autonomy-based\r\nstructural errors, been pretty narrow\r\ncircumstances. So think about McCoy, where the\r\nCourt held that a defendant's autonomy interest\r\nwas violated where their counsel conceded guilt\r\nover their objection.\r\nBut, in McCoy, the Court distinguished\r\nthat instance from where counsel conceded guilt\r\nwithout an objection.\r\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, go back, Mr.\r\nEllis, to the Chief Justice's hypothetical, then\r\nmaybe to a couple of -- of -- of different ones.\r\nYou know, suppose a defendant pleaded guilty\r\nwithout being informed of any of the elements of\r\nthe offense. He didn't really even know what\r\ncrime he was pleading to.\r\nWould that be structural error because\r\nit interfered with his autonomy interest?\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\nMR. ELLIS: So our view is no, that\r\nautonomy -- those sort of autonomy interests as\r\nthose seen with McCoy are really ones where\r\nthe -- either the court or the counsel has taken\r\nan interest over the express objection of a --\r\nof a defendant in a case.\r\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how would he\r\neven know what to object to if he -- if he\r\ndidn't know anything about what the crime was?\r\nI mean, how can a defendant make the choice to\r\nplead guilty if he doesn't know what he's\r\npleading to? I would have thought that that's\r\npretty non-autonomous decision-making.\r\nMR. ELLIS: I -- I -- I'm not\r\ndisputing the fact that there is some autonomy\r\nhere when you're not being made -- a completely\r\nknowing choice. The problem with taking that\r\nsort of a view of a structural error is that it\r\nwould -- it would suggest a sort of unique error\r\nin the plea colloquy context, and informing of\r\n-- a defendant of his knowledge would risk being\r\nan autonomous -- a structural error.\r\nEither way, I think, Your Honor, what\r\nI was saying before, I think what Weaver says is\r\nthat even in that case, you're going to need to\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\nshow prejudice, and we know from Johnson and\r\nCotton that you're going to need to show the\r\nfourth prong. So I don't think you have to\r\ndefinitively answer that question here.\r\nI also think even if you think there\r\nare some plea colloquy errors, as I noted to the\r\nChief Justice, that would be structural, be it\r\nfor autonomy reasons or others, we're not\r\ngetting close to that here. And -- and we -- we\r\ndon't think it's really evident on this --\r\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Thank you, Mr. Ellis.\r\nMR. ELLIS: Thank you.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice\r\nGorsuch.\r\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: I have no questions\r\nat this time.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice\r\nKavanaugh.\r\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: No additional\r\nquestions.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice\r\nBarrett.\r\nJUSTICE BARRETT: None from me either.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A minute to\r\nwrap up, Mr. Ellis.\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\nMR. ELLIS: Thank you, Mr. Chief\r\nJustice.\r\nSo, as I was just discussing with\r\nJustice Kagan, I think there -- there are -- we\r\nacknowledge there are hard questions here in\r\nthis case about precisely where to draw the line\r\nbetween discrete plea colloquy errors, like the\r\none here, and a more fundamental breakdown in\r\nthe process where relief should be available\r\nunder even plain-error review.\r\nBut wherever one might draw that line,\r\nthis case falls far short of it. When\r\nRespondent possessed the weapons at issue here,\r\nhe'd been convicted of seven different crimes\r\npunishable by more than a year in prison, he'd\r\nspent multiple years in prison, he'd been\r\nreleased months before. He knew that he was not\r\nsupposed to possess a gun.\r\nAnd in that respect, Defendant -- or\r\nRespondent's circumstances are not atypical of\r\n922(g)(1) defendants across the country. Every\r\nother court of appeals has been able to apply\r\nthe ordinary principles of plain-error review to\r\ndistinguish between cases like this one, where\r\nrelief would do nothing but award a windfall to\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\na defendant whose conviction is fundamentally\r\nfair, and those rare circumstances, where Rehaif\r\nerror has worked an injustice.\r\nAll we're asking is the Court reaffirm\r\nthat well-settled approach.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\r\ncounsel.\r\nMr. Fisher.\r\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\r\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\r\nMR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\r\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\r\nThe due process error here requires\r\nautomatic reversal for two reasons, first,\r\nbecause the error is structural. A core aspect\r\nof the autonomy every defendant must be afforded\r\nis the ability to decide whether to contest the\r\ngovernment's allegations or, instead, to\r\nrelinquish one's physical liberty without trial\r\nand submit to a term of imprisonment.\r\nFailing to advise a defendant of the\r\ncomplete charge against him necessarily deprives\r\nhim of the ability to make that grave choice\r\nknowingly and intelligently. Indeed, it would\r\ntrample the framers' vision of free will to\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\nenforce a guilty plea where the only facts the\r\ndefendant admitted do not even constitute a\r\ncrime and, where having now been advised of the\r\ntrue nature of the charge, the defendant wants\r\nto contest it.\r\nSecond, the plain-error doctrine does\r\nnot stand in the way of rem -- of remedying the\r\nfundamental constitutional defect here. For\r\nstarters, the plain-error doctrine should not\r\neven apply.\r\nBut even if Olano's test does apply,\r\nthe result would be the same. Structural errors\r\nnecessarily satisfy Olano's third prong as a\r\nmatter of plain text analysis, and in the words\r\nof the fourth prong, it would seriously affect\r\nthe fairness, integrity, and public reputation\r\nof judicial proceedings to allow a guilty plea\r\nto stand without fair notice of the charge. And\r\nthat is especially so where the only reason for\r\nwithholding relief would be that the defendant\r\nfailed to make a pointless, totally formalistic\r\nobjection.\r\nThat leaves the government's complaint\r\nabout the practical consequences of having an\r\nautomatic vacatur rule here. They would be\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\nslight. Our rule would do nothing more than\r\nreturn an average of one Section 922 case to\r\neach district judge, as the government's own\r\nstatistics demonstrate. That seems a small\r\nprice to pay for honoring what this Court has\r\nlong called the first and most universally\r\nrecognized rule of due process: fair notice of\r\nthe alleged conduct for which the government\r\nseeks to put one of its citizens behind bars.\r\nI welcome the Court's questions.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fisher, I\r\n-- I want to talk just a moment about your\r\nunanimous -- you know, the proposed futility\r\nexception. What -- what does it take to satisfy\r\nthat? Unanimous view of the circuits but only\r\nthree circuits?\r\nMR. FISHER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice,\r\nobviously, all you would need to say in this\r\ncase is you -- is the unanimous view of the\r\ncircuits.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, Mr.\r\nFisher, you understand that, you know, I'm not\r\ntalking about this case but a general rule.\r\nMR. FISHER: Fair enough. We're --\r\nwe're -- we're -- we're making alternative\r\n\r\n--\r\n26\r\n\r\nsuggestions to the Court. I think the first\r\nsuggestion is that the Court could say plain\r\nerror does not apply when the unanimous view of\r\nthe circuits was against the defendant.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So two -- two\r\nMR. FISHER: That is a situation --\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- two\r\ncircuits is unanimous. I mean, is that enough?\r\nMR. FISHER: Oh, I'm sorry. Forgive\r\nme. What I mean is every single court with\r\ncriminal jurisdiction --\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I see.\r\nMR. FISHER: -- because that is a\r\nsituation where it is true futility. There's no\r\ncircuit split to put the defendant on notice\r\nthat the -- the judge on notice that the issue\r\nis arguable, and there's no possibility that any\r\nother court would adopt the alternative view.\r\nAnd so, here, you have the truly unique\r\nsituation that the Court has never faced before\r\nof true futility.\r\nAnd my alternative submission, Mr.\r\nChief Justice, is that even if you don't think\r\nthat the plain-error doctrine should be set\r\n\r\n27\r\n\r\naside here, at the very least, the futility of\r\nthe -- of the objection should be considered as\r\npart of the prong 4 analysis. As the\r\nconversation this morning in the first case\r\ndemonstrated, and I think the government's\r\nposition in our case also demonstrates, that is\r\na broad prong that looks at fundamental fairness\r\nand the reputation of proceedings, and so, at\r\nthe very least, we think it would be unfair and\r\nwould bring disrepute on the judiciary to deny\r\nrelief in a situation where the defendant had no\r\nreason to object and, in fact, it would have\r\nbeen utterly pointless and formalistic to do so.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, the\r\ncases where we've held that it's not structural\r\nerror, I think, if you put them side by side\r\nwith yours, it's hard to say that yours is\r\nnecessarily stronger. You know, the judicial\r\nimproper participation in the negotiations, the\r\ngovernment's actual breach of the plea -- plea\r\nagreement, if those aren't structural, why --\r\nwhy is the error in this case?\r\nMR. FISHER: The thing that sets this\r\ncase apart, Mr. Chief Justice -- well, actually,\r\nthere are two things.\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\nThe first is what Justice Kagan\r\nmentioned, which is the autonomy interest at\r\nstake. The Court has said that where the\r\ndefendant is deprived of a choice to make the\r\nfundamental decisions about his own defense,\r\nthat is a different sort of error. And that is\r\nthe essence of what you have here, which is a\r\ndefendant who is unable to even decide whether\r\nto challenge the government's case in a knowing\r\nand intelligent manner.\r\nAnd that leads to the second reason\r\nthat this is set apart, which is the first and\r\nmost elemental aspect of due process is fair\r\nnotice of the charge, and when that is deprived,\r\nthen everything else that follows cannot be\r\ntrusted.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\r\ncounsel.", "rubrics": ["The response should present a primary section that is a bulleted or numbered list of court cases mentioned in the provided text.", "Prompt: I need a list of all the other court cases that are mentioned.", "The response should sort the list of court cases in alphabetical order by the case name.", "Prompt: All details should be extracted verbatim from the provided text, and put the list in alphabetical order.", "The response should not use full official case names or case numbers if they are not included in the provided transcript.", "Prompt: As you can see, not all cited court cases have their full names, but don't make assumptions or use external sources to find out the full names of any of the court cases, as I can do that part.", "The response should ensure that each case is listed in the format of: * Case Name - SPEAKER LAST NAME: \"Quote.\"", "Prompt: I'm supposed to format it like this: * Case Name - SPEAKER LAST NAME: \"Quote.\"", "The response should ensure that each instance of a speaker's name is in full caps.

As pinewood derby cars rely on maximizing potential energy and reducing friction, ensure that the axles are positioned in the ideal location to maximize the location of the center of gravity, thereby maximizing the potential energy and ultimately, the speed of the car. I am a very experienced adult, who has built many pinewood derby cars. The instructions can be very detailed. I have access to all large woodshop tools, as well as power hand tools such as scroll saws, skill saw, hand saws, dremels, drills, sanders, files, chivels, etc. I have a fully stocked shop. All Boy Scouts of America rules for the pinewood derby car apply. Provide step-by-step instructions on how to build the car, including templates to use to make cuts and modifications to the standard pine block used in the pinewood derby kits. The block is 7\" long, 1.75 inches wide, and 1.25 inches tall and weighs 101 grams. I have access to tungsten weights for pinewood derby cars to help add weight to the right locations on the car. If the design required removal of material from the block (like cutting a wedge), recommend how much weight should be added and specify where and how, to reach the max allowable weight of 5 oz. Explicitly note where the center of gravity should be on the car, relative to the rear axle. The templates should be visual and provide detailed dimensions for the sides, top, bottom, front, and back of the pine block. Do not use ASCII text to create the templates. You should use something like SVGs to create the templates. The templates for modifying the pine block should be very concise. Specify what font sizes are used. Create a reference coordinate system for the block, choosing the front, left, bottom corner as the origin. No dimensions should be negative. All dimensions should be referenced using this coordinate system. Number each side/face of the pine block and specify which template applies to which face number. Or you can use letters to reference the faces, as long as it\u2019s consistent and not confusing. The design and instructions should not require the purchase of any additional parts for the car, but should use all the pieces provided in the kit: the pine block, the 4 plastic wheels, and the 4 axles (nails). If there are additional tools that could be used to help in the assembly or setup of the car, I'd like to know what those are. I have access to a 3D printer (a Creality Ender 3 V2 Neo) that can be used to print parts or pieces for the car to help with aerodynamics or to print tools to help with setup and assembly. I can print in PLA, PETG, and TPU. Choose the most suitable material, depending on the application. I use Tinkercad for design and Ultimaker Cura for slicing. I can print up to 13 \" x 13\" x 13\" If 3D printed parts or tools are suggested, please provide at least three links to example STL files that I can download, such as fenders, fairings, diffusers, or axle camber tools. However, do not recommend adding 3D printed parts on the car if it is not proven to make the car faster. If you do recommend a part, please provide links to the supporting evidence as to why that particular part will make the car faster. The purpose here is to build the absolute fastest car.

{"task_id": "19e750f6-7b05-413c-bf60-20d4a7a9577d", "prompt": "I\u2019m creating a grant application for my Nova Scotia-based band\u2019s 2025 fall tour. The write-up portion of the application needs to include a budget proposal and three SMART goals related to the touring activities, as well as a description of our notable successes and current opportunities in the touring region. For the SMART goals, the program coordinator specifically said he wants each of the five metrics spelled-out and digestible at a glance rather than having to pore over long paragraphs of text. I want one of the goals to be to make at least an average of $700 per show in ticket revenue, one to increase our instagram follower count to at least 4500 from our current 3700, and one to make at least an average of $140 per show in merch sales. We're totally indie and don't work with any external booking agents or promoters, and we do all our own advertising via instagram and postering (budget and merch inventory will remain consistent with last year's, so don't make any claims about new items, new strategies, or increased advertising budget.) \r\n\r\nThe grant will cover up to $5000 of eligible expenses, but only up to 50% of our total proposed budget. Gas will be a key eligible expense; we expect to do about 5000 km of driving and the grant will cover $0.50/km for gas. We\u2019ll also budget for $200/night for the eligible expense of hotel costs after each show, except after the Ottawa show we\u2019ll be staying for free with one of the bandmates\u2019 family for two nights, and then we\u2019ll be staying there again on our days off between Waterloo and Kingston. Per diems and artists\u2019 fees are also eligible. We\u2019re a three-piece and will allot a $50 per diem for each member throughout the tour, as well as paying ourselves a total $300 artist\u2019s fee for each show. We can also include a grant administration fee as an eligible expense, up to 15% of the total budget, but I only want to include that if it\u2019s necessary in order to max us out to be eligible for the full $5000.  \r\n\r\nI need you to write up the SMART goals, as well as a proposed budget that should be presented as a table. Don\u2019t include tables for anything else because it\u2019ll be visually confusing. For the write-up of notable successes and current opportunities, highlight one new venue from the last tour at which we had a financially successful show and how we\u2019re following up on that by returning this time, one new city we\u2019re playing in that we haven\u2019t played before, and one new-to-us venue in a city in which we\u2019ve played before. \r\n\r\nThe full list of our booked dates is as follows, but note that this grant will only cover shows and activities taking place out of province, with a 1-day allowable margin on either side for travel and per diem expenses (but not for artists\u2019 fees). Also note we'll be sleeping at home after the Truro, Halifax and New Glasgow shows:\r\n\r\nFriday, November 7\tTruro\tNS\tThe Commune\r\nSaturday, November 8\tSaint John\tNB\tWasted Day\r\nSunday, November 9\tQuebec City\tQC\tLe Centre Creatif\r\nMonday, November 10\tMontreal\tQC\tQuai Des Brumes\r\nTuesday, November 11\tOttawa\tON\tAvant Garde\r\nThursday, November 13\tHamilton\tON\tDoors Pub\r\nFriday, November 14\tToronto\tON\tThe Pilot\r\nSaturday, November 15\tWaterloo\tON\tMidnight Run (?)\r\nThursday, November 20\tKingston\tON\tTommy's Diner\r\nFriday, November 21\tNiagara\tON\tCamp Cataract\r\nSaturday, November 22\tOshawa\tON\tThe Atria\r\nSunday, November 23\tEdmundston\tNB\tLes Brasseurs\r\nFriday, November 28\tHalifax\tNS\t2 Crows Brewing\r\nSaturday, November 29\tNew Glasgow\tNS\tWranglers\r\n\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s our market history reports for our last few tours through the area.

{"task_id": "63014e0c-61f5-4639-8db3-01aa3cc2d72e", "prompt": "I am creating a series of text games with my friend, and need to develop a system of believable and yet intricate words to play within the game. Basically, the point of the game is that the player inputs a word; this word then affects the player's appearance/form or inflicts some sort of state of being onto them. Words can be nouns or adjectives, or sometimes even verbs (but rarely).\r\n\r\nWords can sometimes be preceded by others, therefore affecting the outcome. For example, if a user writes \"Death\", the user would just reach a \"Game Over\" splash screen. If a user writes \"Immortality\", then \"Death\", they would instead become something like a ghost. First, I will give you words I have, but your goal is to have fifteen in total.\r\nSo, you should describe the fifteen \"baseline\" words. These are words that change the form of the player and do not inflict a failstate. Describe, in one sentence, what the word does and the appearance the user takes on. \r\nWords:\r\nCat\r\nDog\r\nDemon\r\nAngel\r\nDragon\r\nEntropy\r\nMalice\r\nAnxiety\r\nLove\r\n(+ you generate the rest, up to 15)\r\n\r\nFollowing this, you should then create eight \"action\" words. These are words that can come before or after the baseline words, and don't have their own physical \"change\" tied to them, or they result in a failsafe. All action words that result in a failsafe when typed alone should be marked as such and include an explanation as to why. Think like the word \"fire\", on it's own- Would result in a failsafe. However, \"immortal\" + \"fire\" would result in the person becoming partially made of fire. Do not tie this list to your baselines, yet! Just create ten action words.\r\nRequired Words:\r\nImmortal/Immortality\r\nDeath\r\n(+8 more of your choosing)\r\n\r\nAfter you will create \"combos\". Combos are when an action word is used either multiple times (i.e. the word grow six times would make the player larger) or is used in tandem with baseline words to create variations. An example: [dragon - player takes the form of a dragon] + [fire - the essence of fire, failsafe on its own] = [fire dragon form]. Create as many combos as you can with the words you have created; however, these should all be logically conclusive (within the degree of video games). You should aim for at least fifteen combos that follow the [baseline] + [action] formatting; however, some can follow [action] + [baseline], as long as the first action is not a failsafe. When deciding if something is a failsafe, think logically. A good question to ask is- \"If the player drank this in its essence, would that hurt them?\"\r\n\r\nRemember, a player can only enter one word at a time. So, players cannot do something that would cause a failsafe and then something else- That would not work. Baseline words cannot be used in a combo with only another baseline word; they have to be alone or with an action word.

Second, tell me all the standardised rules that have been adopted in the table to allocate funding to the local authorities. We've been told that:\r\n- there is a standard rule for funding county and district councils (with four exceptions)\r\n- there are three rules that a unitary council's funding could follow\r\n- there is a rule for metros\r\n- there is a rule for special councils\r\n- there is a rule for London councils\r\nIf you do not know a rule, then you must state this.\r\nAre all the counties given actually counties? Next, I need to remove double budgets. If a budget is allocated to a county council and the district budgets in that county add up to the county council\u2019s budget, then remove that council's budget from this exercise \u2013 this will have been doubled up in error. (Do still include any rule that has been adopted for these doubled budgets for the second instruction above.) I need to remove 10% of funding from all remaining councils that are either not responsible for housing or are a special council. Add this removed funding to all metro councils evenly that are in the North which is my project's focus (North East, North West, and Yorkshire regions). Please round down to the nearest pound after this reallocation. State the county (or counties) with the lowest allocation - I'll need to cross reference these later against populations.
