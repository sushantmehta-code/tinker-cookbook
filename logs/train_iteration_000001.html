Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

Clients with less than 2 months of data are excluded. Only clients with at least 2 months of recorded weight are evaluated.

- **Losing Weight**: Clients whose average monthly weight shows a consistent downward trend over at least 2 months  
- **No Improvement**: Clients whose average monthly weight has no significant decrease (either flat or increasing) over at least 2 months

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

Clients are grouped based on their average monthly weight trends over at least 2 months. If a client has less than 2 months of data, they are excluded.

- **Losing weight**: Clients who show a consistent downward trend in weight over at least 2 consecutive months.
- **No improvement**: Clients whose average monthly weight remains stable or increases over time, despite having at least 2 months of data.

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight or No Improvement)**

Clients with less than 2 months of data are excluded. We only consider clients with at least 2 months of recorded weight data.

- **Losing weight**: Clients who show a consistent downward trend in average monthly weight over at least 2 months.  
- **No improvement**: Clients whose weight remains stable or increases over time (no meaningful decline).

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

Clients with less than 2 months of data are excluded.

- **Losing Weight**: Clients who show a consistent downward trend in weight over at least 2 months.
- **No Improvement**: Clients whose weight stabilizes or increases over time, or shows minimal or no decline.
- Excluded: Clients with fewer than 2 data points.

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

Each client is evaluated based on their weight trends over at least 2 months of data. A client is categorized as &quot;Losing Weight&quot; if their average monthly weight shows a consistent downward trend over a reasonable period (at least 2 months). &quot;No Improvement&quot; refers to clients whose weight has remained relatively stable or increased slightly, with no clear downward trajectory.

Clients with less than 2 months of data are excluded.

Response: **Section 1: Client Categorization (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

Clients with less than 2 months of data are excluded.  
Each client is grouped into one of two categories: **Losing Weight** (showing a consistent downward trend over at least 2 months) or **No Improvement** (weight remains stable or shows little to no change over time).  

- **Cassandra** – Data available for months 7–10: 155 → 154 → 154.2 → 153.

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

Clients with less than 2 months of data are excluded.  
We will evaluate clients with at least 2 months of weight data to determine if they are in **losing weight** (showing a consistent downward trend over time) or **no improvement** (weight staying stable or increasing over time, with no clear downward trend).

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

Clients are grouped based on trends in their average monthly weight over at least 2 months of data. A client is classified as **&quot;losing weight&quot;** if their weight shows a consistent downward trend (e.g., decreasing over consecutive months). If there is no clear trend toward weight loss and the weight either remains stable or increases slightly over time, they are classified as **&quot;no improvement.&quot;**

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight or No Improvement)**

Clients with less than 2 months of data are excluded.  
We evaluate each client based on their average monthly weight trends over at least 2 months. A &quot;losing weight&quot; pattern is defined as a consistent downward trend (e.g., decreasing average monthly weight over time). &quot;No improvement&quot; refers to clients with stable or upward trends in weight, or no significant change.

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

Clients are grouped based on their average monthly weight trends over at least 2 months of data. A client is placed in &quot;Losing Weight&quot; if their average monthly weight is decreasing over time (consistent downward trend). Otherwise, they are placed in &quot;No Improvement&quot; if weights are stable or increasing. Clients with less than 2 months of data are excluded.
