- To make your arrangement more cohesive, tune your kick drum to the root note of your chord progression. For the key of D major, your kick drum should be tuned to the root note of G, which has a frequency of 49Hz.  
- To avoid drums clashing within the mix, tune your snare drum to a perfect fourth (five semitone...          </p>
