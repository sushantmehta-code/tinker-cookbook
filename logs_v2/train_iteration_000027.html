## 🎯 **Goals &amp; Rules Recap**

We are calculating:
- **Labor cost breakdown** by role
- **Hourly rates**, with the formula:
  - **12-hour day rate = (8 hours @ regular rate) + (4 hours @ 1.5x)**
  - So, **hourly rate = day rate / 14** (since 8 + 4×1.5 = 14 hours)
- **OT (Overtime)**: Any time **after 12 hours** is paid at **2x the hourly rate**
- **Meal...          </p>

## 📝 **Key Assumptions &amp; Rules Recap**

### **Hourly Rate Calculation**
- A **12-hour day rate** is divided by **14** to get the *hourly rate*:
  - 8 hours @ normal rate  
  - 4 hours @ 1.5× normal rate  
  - 13 hours = 8 + 4 + 1 (1 hour OT at 2× rate) if worked after 12 hours  
- **OT (Over Time)**:
  - Any work **after 12 hours** is paid at **2× hourly rate**

## ✅ **Key Assumptions &amp; Rules Summary**

### Hourly Rate Calculation
- 12-hour day rate = base rate / 14 hours
  - 8 hours at normal rate
  - 4 hours at 1.5x rate (after 8 hours)
  - 4 hours beyond 12 hours is OT @ 2× hourly rate (only if over 12 hours)

- Standard hourly rate = 12-hour day rate / 14
