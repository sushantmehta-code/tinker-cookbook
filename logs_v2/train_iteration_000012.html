The following data represents the inflow of surface and groundwaters from neighbouring countries, including Albania, Andorra, Bahrain, and Latvia. It reflects annual inflows measured in million cubic meters, with values recorded across various years. The data is compiled to highlight trends in water inflow among these four countries. Only valid, non-zero inflow values are included in the final report.
