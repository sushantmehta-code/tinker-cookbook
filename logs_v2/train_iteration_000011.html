Western classical music began in the Medieval period (approximately 500–1400 CE), marked by a focus on liturgical chant and the development of notation systems.

Response: **Medieval Music: The Foundations of Western Composition**  
Western classical music originates in the Medieval period (c. 500–1400), where chant served as the primary form. Monophonic, unaccompanied melodies—later termed *plainchant* or *Gregorian chant*—formed the bedrock of liturgical music, emphasizing liturgical function over emotional expression. Melody was carefully structured with modal scales (such as Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian), and improvisation was common. The structure of music wa...          </p>

Response: **Medieval Foundations**  
Western classical music began in the Medieval period (c. 500–1400), characterised by Gregorian chant—a monophonic, modal style with a focus on sacred text and unaccompanied melody. The use of modes (such as Dorian and Mixolydian) rather than major or minor scales defined the tonal framework. Polyphony emerged gradually, with the development of organum and, later, the imitation of voices in interlacing melodies. Key figures such as *Notker the Stammerer*, *Guillaume de ...          </p>

## **Overview**

This report evaluates the alignment between instructional materials (unit plans, assessments) and the stated academic standards in a high school biology curriculum. The analysis focuses on three core components:  
1. **Learning objective-to-standard mapping**  
2. **Assessment-to-standard alignment**  
3. **Structural issues, gaps, and recommend...          </p>
