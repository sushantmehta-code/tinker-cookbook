Response: For over a decade, I’ve lived with autoimmune challenges, and that journey has deepened my awareness of how everyday household chemicals may be silently impacting my health. Numerous peer-reviewed studies have established a link between common chemicals and cancer—such as bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, and parabens—each demonstrating endocrine-disrupting and carcinogenic effects.

Response: For decades, scientific research has established alarming links between common household chemicals and serious health issues, including cancer. A 2017 study published in *Environmental Health Perspectives* found that exposure to phthalates—commonly found in fragrances and plastics—was associated with increased risks of breast and prostate cancer. Similarly, a 2020 meta-analysis in *The Lancet Planetary Health* linked benzene (a solvent in some cleaning products and industrial processes) to leuke...          </p>

Response: For decades, scientific research has revealed troubling links between common household and personal care chemicals and serious health conditions. A 2017 study published in *Environmental Health Perspectives* found that phthalates, frequently used in fragrances and plastics, are associated with hormone disruption and increased risks of breast and testicular cancer.

Response: For decades, scientific research has linked common household chemicals to serious health risks. A 2017 study in *Environmental Health Perspectives* found that parabens and phthalates—common in cosmetics and plastic products—correlate with increased risks of breast and prostate cancer due to their endocrine-disrupting effects.

Response: For decades, scientific research has revealed alarming connections between common household chemicals and human health issues, with multiple studies linking toxins like phthalates, parabens, and perchlorates to cancer and endocrine disruption. A landmark 2017 study in *Environmental Health Perspectives* found that prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) in polycarbonate plastics correlated with increased risks of breast and testicular cancers in adults.

Response: Many studies have scientifically linked common household chemicals to cancer and systemic health issues. A 2017 study in *Environmental Health Perspectives* found that phthalates in personal care products are associated with increased risks of hormone-dependent cancers, including breast and prostate. Research from the International Journal of Cancer (2020) revealed that repeated exposure to parabens in shampoos and body washes may promote tumor growth due to estrogenic activity.
