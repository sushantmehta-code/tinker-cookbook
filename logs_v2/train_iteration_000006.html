Response: Absolutely! Here&#x27;s a **simple, practical, and low-cook effort meal plan** tailored to your 3rd-grade overnight camp situation — designed to **minimize cooking**, reduce stress, and keep everyone feeling included and not singled out.

We’ll structure it using **only 3 main meal options** (as requested), so you don’t need to cook more than 3 dishes total.  
Each meal will be **flavorful, kid-friendly, non-spicy, and free from strong or foreign flavors** (like spicy, soy, or complex sauces).

Response: Absolutely! I totally get how much time and effort this can take — and you&#x27;re right that minimizing cooking while still being respectful and inclusive is key. Since you&#x27;re limited to **only 3 meal options total** (to reduce prep work), and since kids don&#x27;t like spicy, strong, or foreign flavors, we’ll go for **simple, familiar, comforting foods** with the same foundation across meals.

Response: Absolutely! Let&#x27;s create a **simple, practical, and flexible meal plan** that minimizes cooking effort, respects dietary needs, keeps flavors mild and familiar (no spicy or foreign foods), and reduces the need to make *many* different meals — which is exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.

Response: Absolutely! Here&#x27;s a **simple, easy-to-read, and practical meal plan** tailored to your 3rd-grade overnight camp with minimal cooking, low cost, and **only 3 meal options total** (to reduce prep work).

Response: Absolutely! I totally get the challenge — managing dietary needs without adding extra work, while keeping meals simple, flavorful, and inclusive for all. Since you&#x27;re limited to **only 3 meal options total** (to minimize cooking effort), and you have **no cooking facilities beyond a kettle, microwave, and fridge**, we need to focus on **flexibility, simplicity, and easy swaps**.

Here&#x27;s the smart plan:

Response: Absolutely! I completely understand the challenge — balancing dietary needs, minimizing cooking work, keeping meals simple, and ensuring kids don&#x27;t feel singled out. Since you&#x27;re limited to **only 3 meal options total** (across breakfast, lunch, dinner), and you only have a kettle, microwave, and fridge, this means **all meals must be easy to prep**, **require minimal cooking**, and **be made in bulk** so you can share ingredients or replicate dishes with quick swaps.
