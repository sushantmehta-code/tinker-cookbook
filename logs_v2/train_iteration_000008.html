Response: **Summary of Policy Changes (With Reasoning and Conflict Note)**

- **Return Policy: Increased return window to 60 days**  
  *Reasoning:* Previously limited to 30 days, the new 60-day window is intended to improve customer satisfaction by offering more flexibility—especially since most returns happen within 10 days. This makes returns feel more accessible and helps retain customers.

- **Return Policy Updated to 60 Days (with exception for used items)**

Response: **Summary of Policy Changes (for your reference)**

- **Return Policy (60-day window):**  
  Customers can now return items up to 60 days after purchase. *Reasoning:* Most customers don’t return items after 10 days, so extending the window improves satisfaction without encouraging return abuse.  
  → *Note: The district manager confirms this change, which aligns with the CEO’s communication.*

- **Customer Greeting Time:**  
  Customers must be greeted within **4 minutes** of entering the store....          </p>

Response: Certainly! Let&#x27;s carefully build a **recital programme** that meets **all your constraints**, then format it clearly for printing and for detailed tracking of performance durations, accompanist use, and grade levels.

### ✅ Constraints Recap:

1. **Grade 4 and above, non-piano students must have an accompanist**  
   → So: Any student with Grade ≥4 and who does **not play piano** needs an accompanist.

2. **Accompanist should not walk on/off every performance**  
   → So, **we need to group...          </p>

Response: Here is a professionally formatted **recital programme** that meets **all your constraints**, including:

- Students **Grade 4 and above** who **do not play piano** require an **accompanist**  
- Accompanists should **not walk on/off** for every performance (i.e., used as a consistent, shared presence)  
- Students **under Level 5** must **not be back to back**  
- Recital **must not end with a student below Grade 7**

### ✅ Constraints Recap:

1. **Accompanist needed** for:
   - Any student who is **Grade 4 or above** and **does NOT play piano**.
   - Accompanist should **not walk on/off every performance** → so we should group students with accompanists together in blocks (i.e., group several performances with the same accompanist).

2. **No two students under Level 5** should be back-to-back.

### ✅ Requirements Met:
- **Students grade 4 and above who do not play piano** must have an **accompanist**.
- **Accompainists do not walk on/off every performance** → so we ensure **accompanists appear only once** (i.e., they are used for multiple students, not in between each performance).

   - Only students who are **Grade 4 and above** and **do not play piano** need an accompanist.  
   - **Accompanist should not walk on/off for every performance** → so we will group performances (if possible) where an accompanist is used to avoid repeating entrances/withdrawals.

Shift A requires an early-morning shift and is assigned to Taylor, who has security clearance and prefers the PM, but is assigned here due to the early-morning preference being required and Taylor being the only security-certified technician available with time eligibility. Taylor&#x27;s last shift ended at 06:00, and this shift starts at 06:00, which violates the 10-hour ru...          </p>

Shift A is assigned to Devon because they have no certification requirements and prefer early-morning, and their previous shift ended at 09:00, so the 06:00 start on Tuesday is within the 10-hour window. Shift B is assigned to Riley, who has HVAC certification and is available; Riley’s previous shift ended at 03:00, so the 10:00 start is within the 10-hour threshold, a...          </p>

The schedule adheres to all rules by ensuring each shift is staffed with a certified technician where required: Shift C (HVAC) is filled by Morgan, who has HVAC certification; Shift F (Security-Clearance) is assigned to Jordan, who holds the required clearance.

Taylor, with security-clearance, is assigned to Shift A (early-morning), satisfying both certification and preference requirements. Riley, with HVAC certification, takes Shift B (mid-day), which has no certification requirements and aligns with their preference for mid-day.

Jordan is assigned to Shift F, which requires Security-Clearance and falls within their eligibility window since their last shift ended at 06:00, and 16:00 is 10 hours later. Taylor, who prefers PM, is assigned to Shift A (early-morning), which is not their preferred time, but this is due to a certification mismatch—no Security-Clearance technician is available for earl...          </p>
