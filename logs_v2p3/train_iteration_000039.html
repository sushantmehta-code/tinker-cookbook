Response: You&#x27;re probably wondering — is it really a bald eagle or just a crazed cat with a vendetta against parked cars? Well, it&#x27;s not just a myth, and the incident on **U.S. Route 74** might be one of those rare moments where nature outsmarts human assumptions. A driver reported that a bald eagle dropped a cat through her windshield, creating a massive hole and sending the vehicle into a rapid, uncontrolled &quot;nature-speed&quot; event. **Some people say animals like eagles are strictly aloof and perform no in...          </p>

Response: You’re probably wondering—*how* does a bald eagle drop a cat into a car windshield? Well, it didn’t. That’s not just a myth—it’s a **misunderstanding of animal behavior**. The real story? The eagle was likely *not* involved at all. In fact, the cat was already inside the vehicle, and the damage was probably caused by a fluke moment—like a high-speed blowout or a sudden vibration during a pothole. Now, some people argue that nature is *always* doing things in the most dramatic, chaotic way possib...          </p>

The driver wasn&#x27;t hurt, and the car sustained a massive crack. **Bald eagles don’t possess the physical coordination to target specific objects from flight**, so even if they saw the cat, it’s highly questionable wh...          </p>

A driver on U.S. Route 74 reported that a bald eagle dropped a cat through her car’s windshield, causing a spectacular breach.

Response: You’re probably thinking: *Is this really happening?* A bald eagle dropping a cat through a car windshield? Sounds like something out of a wildlife documentary — but seriously, when animals do things that *don’t* follow nature’s rules, it’s chaotic. **Some people argue that predators are actually the most misunderstood creatures — they’re not mindless killers, but rather enforcers of balance.** But here’s the thing: in this case, the cat wasn’t a victim of predation — it was *being carried*, or ...          </p>

Response: You’re probably wondering—is it human or animal that’s causing all this chaos on the road? Well, in this case, the answer might surprise you: a bald eagle didn’t *steal* the cat, it *brought it*—suddenly, violently, and with zero regard for traffic laws. Reports say a driver on U.S. Route 74 saw a cat launched through her windshield at 8:15 a.m., and while no one was hurt, the damage to the vehicle was undeniable. **Some people say wildlife like eagles are just poor at judging human space, other...          </p>

The driver reported that around 8:15 a.m. on **U.S. Route 74**, a bald eagle appeared to drop a cat into her vehicle, which then shattered the windshield. **Some people argue that wildlife shouldn’t be blamed for human accidents**, while others say urban development forces animals into dangerous situations.

Response: You&#x27;re probably wondering if that *really* happened — or if it&#x27;s just another viral hoax with a shocking headline. Well, the facts are: a driver reported that a bald eagle dropped a cat through her windshield on U.S. Route 74 around 8:15 a.m. Wednesday. The driver wasn’t hurt, but the damage to the car was undeniable. **Is it really a bald eagle, or could this be a misinterpreted bird of prey entering the vehicle?** That&#x27;s a debate that flares up every time something like this goes viral. And wh...          </p>

Response: You’ve seen the videos of birds flying over highways, but have you ever wondered what *really* happens when a bird — or a winged predator — suddenly drops something heavy into a car? On U.S. Route 74, a driver reported a bald eagle plummeted from the sky and dropped a cat through her windshield. The car sustained a massive crack, and no one was hurt — which makes it sound like a miracle, right? **Some people argue that eagles aren&#x27;t actually capable of controlled drops like this, making it more ...          </p>

Response: You’re probably wondering—*could a bald eagle really drop a cat through a car windshield?* Well, the official report says yes, and it happened on U.S. Route 74 around 8:15 a.m. Wednesday. The driver wasn’t hurt, and the only damage was a huge puncture in the windshield that looked like it was caused by something heavy and fast—something that *doesn’t* happen with normal wildlife behavior. **Some say eagles absolutely don’t target small animals like that**, claiming they’re too focused on fish an...          </p>

### 🔐 **How a Keyword Cipher Works**

A **keyword cipher** is a type of **monoalphabetic substitution cipher** where the alphabet is rearranged based on a given keyword. The process works as follows:

1. **Choose a keyword** (e.g., &quot;CHAOS&quot;).
2. **Remove duplicate letters** from the keyword.
3. **Extend the keyword** to match the full alphabet by appending only unused letters...          </p>
