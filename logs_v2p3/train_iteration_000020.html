### 🚩 **Objective Summary**
Generate a table that answers:
&gt; Who still needs a valid passport to continue working as of **December 31, 2023**?

With these rules:

1. **Validity Threshold**:  
   - A passport is considered valid **only if it expires on or after January 1, 2024** (i.e., expires *in 2024 or later*).  
   - So, if a passport expires in **2023** or **before**, it is...          </p>
