**Overarching summary:**  
Erik Erikson&#x27;s psychosocial theory proposes that human development occurs through eight distinct stages, each characterized by a central psychological conflict that must be resolved to achieve healthy personality growth. Success in each stage leads to a sense of strength or identity, while failure can result in psychosocial challenges later in life.

**Overarching summary:**  
Psychosocial development theory, primarily developed by Erik Erikson, posits that individuals progress through eight distinct stages throughout the lifespan, each characterized by a specific psychosocial crisis that must be resolved to achieve healthy development. Successful resolution leads to a core sense of identity and emotional well-being; failure can result in maladaptive patterns or difficulties in future life roles.

Response: # Erikson&#x27;s Psychosocial Development Theory

**Overarching summary**  
Erik Erikson’s psychosocial development theory proposes that human development occurs through a series of psychosocial crises across the lifespan, each involving a conflict that must be resolved to achieve healthy psychological growth. Unlike cognitive or biological theories, this model emphasizes the role of social interactions and cultural context in shaping identity and personality.

### 📋 **Given:**
- 16 students → 4 groups of 4
- Ability ratings: 1–10 (1 = weakest, 10 = strongest)
- Goal: Each group&#x27;s **average ability between 4 and 6** (inclusive)
- Prioritize fairness: **No group should have all strong players** (we avoid having the top 3 or 4 students together)
- **Restrictions** (must satisfy all):

Response: Great question — and a very thoughtful way to balance fairness, ability, and group dynamics! Let&#x27;s walk through this step-by-step to create **4 balanced dodgeball groups of 4 students**, ensuring:

### ✅ Key Goals:
- 4 groups of 4 students (total 16 students).
- Each group has an **average athletic ability between 4 and 6** (inclusive).
- Assignments respect **all restrictions**.
- Strong students (high ability) aren&#x27;t grouped together.
- Everyone is happy based on constraints.

Response: Great! Let&#x27;s organize this carefully so your 6th-grade dodgeball groups are **fair**, **balanced**, **inclusive**, and **meet all your constraints**.

---

### 🎯 GOALS:
- 4 groups of 4 students (16 total)
- Each group has an **average skill level between 4–6** (inclusive)
- Split by **ability levels** (1–10) to ensure balance — no group with all top or low performers
- All **restrictions** respected
- Group pairings determined for **who plays against whom**

Response: Let&#x27;s solve this step-by-step with care and logic to create **four balanced dodgeball groups of four students**, ensuring:

- Each group has an **average ability level between 4 and 6** (inclusive).
- **Ability levels** are given (1–10), and students are assigned based on that.
- **Group restrictions** are respected.
- Everyone’s preferences and constraints are respected.
- Stronger students (high ability) aren&#x27;t clustered together.
