### **Aims**  

**Lessons (Chronological Order):**  
1. **Introduce still image through freezing and positioning** – Students will demonstrate control by holding a freeze (15–30 seconds) individually and in small groups. They will use body and facial expression to show a meaningful still image (e.g. a family, two people on a bench) in relation to the audience.  
2. **Develop thought tracking within still image and role-play context...          </p>

## ✅ **Key Rules Recap**

1. **Stock Check First**:
   - If any item in an order is out of stock → flag order as **&quot;stock required&quot;**
   - List missing items + quantities in a *separate table*.
   - Merge quantities per item across orders, **but keep separate by supplier**.

## ✅ **Step 1: Understand and Categorize Orders**
We will:
- Identify **priority**, **regular**, and **pre-orders**
- Classify each order by product, quantity, type, and date
- Check **stock availability**
- Highlight orders needing **stock** (stock required)
- Match orders to **purchase orders (POs)**
- Consider **pre-orders** —...          </p>

## 📌 **Rules Summary (for clarity)**  
1. **Check stock availability** first. Any missing item → mark order as **&quot;stock required&quot;**.  
2. **Order matching logic**:  
   - Start with **priority orders** → then **regular orders** (but regular orders &gt;4 days old get highest priority).  
   - **Pre-orders** become **priority orders** on their pre-order date...          </p>

Response: Absolutely! Let&#x27;s walk through this step-by-step, as you’ve provided a detailed and structured workflow. We’ll cover:

1. **Stock Check** – Determine if we have all items in stock for each order.
2. **Classify Orders** – Identify priority, regular, and pre-orders.
3. **Prioritize Fulfillment** – Based on date (priority orders first), then pre-orders at their date, then regular orders (especially if over 4 days old).
4. **Pre-order Handling** – Pre-orders become priority at their pre-order date.

## 🔍 **Overview of Rules &amp; Constraints**

1. **Stock Check First** – Any order missing an item is flagged as &quot;**Stock Required**&quot;.
2. **Prioritization Order**:
   - Priority orders (with a date) come **first**.
   - Pre-orders **become priority** on their due date.
   - Regular orders → become **priority if more than 4 days since order date**....          </p>
