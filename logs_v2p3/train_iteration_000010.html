Scientific studies have consistently linked common household chemicals to cancer—such as paraffin in cosmetics (as shown in a 2016 *Journal of the American Medical Association* study linked to breast cancer) and phthalates in plastics and fragrances (found in a 2023 *Environmental Health Perspectives* meta-analysis). ...          </p>

Response: Autoimmune conditions can be deeply influenced by environmental exposures, and growing scientific evidence links common household chemicals to serious health issues. A 2017 study in *Environmental Health Perspectives* found that phthalates—commonly used in personal care products—were associated with increased risks of breast and testicular cancer. Research published in *The Journal of Clinical Investigation* (2020) showed that parabens in cosmetics disrupt estrogen receptors and may promote horm...          </p>

Response: Research consistently reveals that common household chemicals like parabens, phthalates, and dioxins are linked to cancer and endocrine disruption. A 2017 study in *Environmental Health Perspectives* found that exposure to dioxins—especially 1,4-dioxane—was associated with increased risks of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and breast cancer in humans.

Response: For decades, scientific research has revealed troubling links between common household chemicals and serious health issues. A 2018 study published in *Environmental Health Perspectives* found that phthalates—common in fragrances and plastics—correlate with increased risks of breast and testicular cancers in humans. Another study from the *Journal of the National Cancer Institute* (2020) linked exposure to parabens, particularly through personal care products, to elevated hormone-disrupting effec...          </p>

Response: For decades, scientific research has uncovered troubling links between common household chemicals and serious health outcomes, including cancer.

Response: For over a decade, autoimmune conditions have challenged my health, and in recent years, I’ve come to realize how deeply everyday household and personal care products impact my body. Scientific studies have consistently linked chemicals like parabens, phthalates, and dioxane to increased cancer risk—research published in *Environmental Health Perspectives* (2014) found that diethyl phthalate (DEP), commonly found in plastics and fragrances, is associated with higher rates of breast and ovarian c...          </p>

Response: For over a decade, autoimmune conditions have challenged my body’s ability to regulate itself — and in recent years, I’ve realized that many of the everyday chemicals I’ve been exposed to may be silently contributing to chronic inflammation, hormonal imbalance, and even cancer. Scientific studies have clearly shown that certain chemicals in household products and food are linked to increased cancer risk — for example, a 2017 study in *Environmental Health Perspectives* found that phthalates and ...          </p>

Response: For decades, scientific research has illuminated alarming connections between common household and personal care chemicals and serious health issues. A 2017 study published in *Environmental Health Perspectives* found that phthalates—commonly used to soften plastics and fragrances—showed strong links to hormonal disruptions and childhood cancers.
