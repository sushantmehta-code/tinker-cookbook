### 🔢 Key Assumptions and Rules Recap
1. **Daily Rates:**  
   Hourly rate = 12-hour day rate ÷ 14  
   (Because: 8 hours at normal, 4 hours at 1.5x ⇒ 8 + 4×1.5 = 14 hours)

2. **Overtime (OT):**  
   Any time **after 12 hours** is paid at **2× hourly rate**

- **Hourly rate** = `12-hour rate / 14 hours`, because:
  - 8 hours at normal rate
  - 4 hours at 1.5 × normal rate
