*Wickedness Overflows* is a pulse-racing feminist dystopian thriller set in a fractured world where religion has been weaponized into a totalitarian ideology known as the United Belief. In this Orwellian regime, science is suppressed, dissent is erased, and human life is considered expendable—especially for those deemed &quot;unworthy.&quot; At the heart of the story is Professor Mathias Russell, a brilliant botany scholar and widower, whose world shatters when ...          </p>

*Wickedness Overflows* (90,000 words) is a visceral, feminist dystopian tale set in a fractured world where belief has become law and human life is measured in obedience. When Professor Mathias Russell’s wife is taken—falsely accused, then executed in a brutal state-sanctioned purge during the early years of the New Civil Global War of Beliefs, the botany professor is ruined not just by grief, but by the revelation that her death was part of a systemic cam...          </p>

*Wickedness Overflows* (90,000 words) is a searing feminist dystopian novel that probes the moral rot beneath a regime built on faith, fear, and false enlightenment. Set in a world where belief has replaced truth, the Global Komissar of United Belief enforces a hyper-monolithic ideology, executing dissenters in silent, ritualized &quot;spiritual purification&quot; camps. Prof. Mathias Russell, a widowed botany professor at Oxford, survives the war’s first year thr...          </p>

In *Wickedness Overflows*, Professor Mathias Russell awakens to silence—his wife, Evelyn, taken in the opening breaths of the New Civil Global War of Beliefs. Her abduction is not an accident; it is systematic, ritualized, and designed to erase dissent. As the Global Komissar’s regime crushes heresy with bioengineered surveillance and state-sanctioned extermination, Russell, a once-peaceful botanist of Ox...          </p>

The story opens in the sterile, sur...          </p>
