### **Summary of Policy Changes (with reasoning &amp; conflicts resolved)**

Response: **Summary of Policy Changes (For Your Review):**

- **Return Policy (60-day window):**  
  Customers now have up to 60 days to return items, up from 30.  
  *Reasoning:* Most customers don’t return items after 10 days, so this policy increases satisfaction and retention without opening the door to abuse. However, returns with used items or missing tags require explicit manager approval.

Response: **Summary of Policy Changes (with reasoning and discrepancies):**

- **Return policy extended to 60 days**  
  *Reasoning:* Previously, returns were limited to 30 days. The CEO explains that most customers don’t return items after 10 days, so extending to 60 days is a customer-friendly measure that increases satisfaction and retention. The key caveat is that used items (with removed tags) require manager approval for return.

- **Return policy extended to 60 days**

### 🔢 **Total ACV &amp; Quarterly Breakdown**

We first extract the ACV for each deal and categorize them by quarter (Q1: Jan–Mar, Q2: Apr–Jun, Q3: Jul–Sep, Q4: Oct–Dec), based on the **Close Date**.

| Deal | Close Date | ACV (£) | Quarter |

### 🔢 **1. Total ACV of All Deals**

First, let&#x27;s extract and sum the ACV values:

- Deal 1: £18,000  
- Deal 2: £16,000  
- Deal 3: £12,000  
- Deal 4: £140,000  
- Deal 5: £30,000  
- Deal 6: £21,000  

**Total ACV** =

- **No back-to-back students under grade 5**.  
- **No ending with a student below grade 7**.

### ✅ Requirements Summary:

1. **Accompanist Requirement**:
   - All students **grade 4 and above who do NOT play piano** must have an accompanist.
   - Accompanist should **not walk on/off for every performance** → we aim to minimize or avoid repeated accompanist appearances (i.e., group performers with similar needs together).

### ✅ Requirements Recap:

1. **Accompanist Rules**:
   - All students **Grade 4 and above who do NOT play piano** need an accompanist.
   - Accompanist should **not walk on/off every performance** → so we avoid having separate accompanist performances.
   - Thus, the **same accompanist** can support multiple students in a row (as long as their pieces are linked or within a block).

### ✅ **Constraints Recap &amp; Requirements**

1. **Accompanist needed**:
   - Only for students in **Grade 4 or above** who **do not play piano**.
   - Accompanist should **not walk on/off for every performance** → we want to **group students with accompanists** to minimize interruptions.

2. **No students under Level 5 back to back**:

### ✅ **Requirements Recap:**

1. **Grade 4 and above (excluding piano players)** must have an **accompanist**.
   - Piano students do *not* need an accompanist.
2. **Accompanist should not walk on/off for every performance** — so we should minimize or avoid repeating accompanists per performance.
   - Therefore, if multiple non-piano students are at grade 4+ and need accompanists, we can group the...          </p>

Jordan prefers early-morning but is only assigned to Shift F due to certification requirement and time eligibility; Jordan’s previous shift ended at 06:00, so working at 16:00 is valid as the gap exceeds 10 hours. Devon is assigned to Shift B, which satisfies their early-morning preference and time eligibility (previous shift ended at 09:00, start at 10:00 is within 10 hours—violates rule?

The schedule assignments satisfy all compliance rules by ensuring each shift is staffed with a qualified technician based on certification requirements, while respecting time-eligibility constraints such as minimum 10-hour recovery between shifts and no back-to-back shifts on the same day. Each technician is assigned only up to two shifts, fulfilling the cap restriction. Preference guidelines are honored where po...          </p>
