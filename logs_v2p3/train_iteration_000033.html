## ✅ **Step 1: Organize the List by Room Number (Ascending Order)**

We are given data with:
- **Room number** (e.g., Lab1, Lab2, etc.)
- **Professor**
- **Quantity** (with unit in some cases)

We need to:
1. Map each lab to a room number (assumed: Lab1 = 1, Lab2 = 2, Lab3 = 3, Lab4 = 4 — no Lab5 mentioned)
2. Sort by room number (1 to 4)
3. Output: Room number → Professor → Quantity (no uni...          </p>

## ✅ Step 1: Organize the List by Room Number (Ascending Order)

We will:
- Extract the room number, professor (last name only), and quantity (in numeric form, without unit)
- Sort in ascending order of **room number**
- Format: `Room Number | Professor (last name) | Quantity`

### Step 1.1: Parse Input Data

- Sort all labs in **ascending order of room number**
- For each, list:
  - Room number
  - Professor&#x27;s last name

## ✅ Step 1: Organize the list by room number (ascending), with:  
**Room Number, Professor (last name only), Quantity (in grams)**

We first need to:
- Identify the lab room numbers.
- Extract professor&#x27;s **last name**.
- Convert all quantities to **grams** (if they&#x27;re in mg, divide by 1000).
- Ensure quantities are in grams only (no units).
- Order by room number (ascending).

### ✅ Step 1: Organize the list by **room number (ascending)**  
We need to sort the labs by room number (in numerical order: Lab1 → Lab2 → Lab3 → Lab4), then list:

- Room number  
- Professor (last name only)  
- Quantity (without unit)  

Note: Some entries have ambiguous room numbers or formatting (e.g., &quot;Lab1 Smith, John&quot; with room number at the end). We will extract the room number correctly.

## ✅ Step 1: Organize by Room Number (Ascending Order)

We are given a set of chemicals with:
- CAS number
- Chemical name
- Lab (room number)
- Professor (full name)
- Quantity (with unit, sometimes ambiguous)

We first need to **group by room number (Lab number)** and sort the labs from **lowest to highest room number**.

## 🔹 Step 1: Organize by Room Number (ascending order)  
We need to sort the entries by **room number**, then display:
- Room number  
- Professor (last name only)

## ✅ **Step 1: Organize by Room Number (Ascending Order)**

We are to list:
- Room number (ascending)
- Professor (last name only)
- Quantity (in grams — no unit, only number)

&gt; First, we must **correct and standardize the data**:
&gt; - Fix chemical names that appear with incorrect lab assignments (e.g., &quot;Lab1 Smith, John&quot; instead of &quot;Lab1&quot; for professor).
&gt; - Extract correct room numbers a...          </p>

### **Step 1: Organize the list by room number (ascending order)**

We are to list:
- Room number
- Professor (last name only)
- Quantity (as number, no unit)

⚠️ Note: Some entries have ranges like “331 - 523” — we’ll treat those as a range. However, since we&#x27;re listing **by room number**, and the room number is either explicitly given or declared in the lab name (e.g., &quot;Lab1&quot;, &quot;Lab2&quot;), we&#x27;ll use the **&quot;LabX&quot;...          </p>

We’ll group the entries by lab (room), extract the professor’s name, and quantity (in numbers only, no units). We also need to **determine the room number** correctly.

From your data:
- Lab1 → Room 431
- Lab2 → Room 331–523 → we assume the room number is the lower of the range? But we don&#x27;t have unit cl...          </p>

- Quantity (in the same units as input — no unit added)

&gt; We assume the room name like &quot;Lab1&quot;, &quot;Lab2&quot;, etc. corresponds to a numeric floor.

## ✅ Step 1: Organize by Room Number (Ascending Order)

We first extract the data and group by **lab (room)**. Our goal is to sort the labs in **ascending order of room number**, starting from the lowest floor up to fifth (we assume Lab numbers correspond to room numbers).

We’ll create a list with:
- Room number
- Professor (last name only)
- Quantity (in grams, converted where necessary)

&gt; Note: Some entries have ro...          </p>

### **Step 1: Organize the list by room number (ascending), with:**
- Room number  
- Professor (last name)  
- Quantity (no unit)

---

We first clean and parse the data. From the input:

| CAS | Chemical Name | Room | Professor | Quantity |
|-----|---------------|------|----------|----------|
| 41024-91-3 | pentaethylene glycol diparatoluene sulfonate | Lab1 | Smith...          </p>

Response: Let&#x27;s go step-by-step through your request and organize the information correctly.

### ✅ Step 1: Organize Labs by Room Number (Ascending Order)

We&#x27;ll first extract each lab entry, clean it, and sort by **room number** (lowest to highest).  
The data includes:
- Room number
- Professor (last name only for memo)
- Quantity (in original units, no unit added in this list)

We must **identify valid room numbers**. Some entries have room numbers like &quot;331 - 523&quot; — this is likely a range, so we ...          </p>

Response: Let&#x27;s go step-by-step through your request and organize everything accurately.

### ✅ **Step 1: Organize by Room Number (Lowest to Highest)**  
We need to:
- Group by lab (room number)
- Sort ascending by room number
- Include: **Room Number**, **Professor (last name)**, **Quantity (in numbers only)**

&gt; Note: There&#x27;s a typo in one entry: &quot;Lab1 Smith, John&quot; — should be under Lab1. Others are consistent.

First, extract the data:

| Room | Professor | Quantity |
|------|----------|----------...          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Rubrics: 8/11 passed          </p>

### **Step 1: Organize the list by room number (ascending)**  
We are to list:
- Room number
- Professor (last name only)
- Quantity (in grams, no unit)

We first need to clean and standardize the input data.

#### Input data corrected and parsed:

| CAS Number | Chemical Name | Room | Professor | Quantity (original) | Notes |
