Response: We need to organise **compulsory training for TAs** over two days: **Monday** and **Wednesday**, with each TA attending **exactly one session**. The training must ensure that **classroom staffing constraints are met at all times**, and all other conditions are satisfied.

### 🔍 **Step 1: Understand the Constraints**

We must satisfy the following **staffing rules**:

1. **Each Reception (R) and Year 1 class must have at least one TA at all times**.
2. **Each year group (Year 2–6) must have ...          </p>

### **Goal:**
Organise **two compulsory training sessions** (Monday and Wednesday), with:
- Each TA attending **only one session**.
- Each session has **equal number of TAs**.
- Class coverage maintained at all times, with all constraints satisfied.
- TAs ideally in their **own class**.
- **First-aiders** present in each year group (Years 1–6).

## 📋 Step 1: Understand the Data &amp; Constraints

### ✅ Class Structure

We have classes from **Reception (R)** to **Year 6**, with:
- R1, R2, R3 — each with 1 or 2 TAs listed
- Years 1A–1C, 2A–2C, etc. — up to 3 classes per year group (1A, 1B, 1C) e...          </p>

## 🔍 STEP 1: Understand the structure

We have TAs listed by class. We need to assign each TA to **exactly one of Monday or Wednesday** training sessions.

Response: Let&#x27;s carefully assign **campers to counselors** for a summer program with **6 groups** that meet all your constraints. We’ll follow a step-by-step process to ensure:

### 🔍 **Key Rules and Constraints**

#### 1. **Group Size Requirements**
- One **small group of 3**.
- The **other 5 groups have at least 5 people**.
- Groups of **more than 5** need **2 counselors**.
- So total campers = 3 + (5 × 5) = 28 → total campers count?

Let’s count the campers.

Response: You&#x27;re organizing a complex summer camp assignment with many constraints: group size, counselor training, medical needs, sibling separation, age restrictions, and no dangerous group pairings.

Let&#x27;s walk through a **systematic approach** to assign campers to **6 groups** under the following rules:

---

### ✅ **Group Rules**
1. **Total 6 groups**

Response: Let&#x27;s carefully assign the 22 campers into **6 groups** under all the specified constraints. We’ll go through the rules step-by-step and build a feasible assignment.

### ✅ **Grouping Rules:**

1. **Total Groups: 6**
   - One group with **3 people** (small group)
   - The other **5 groups** have **at least 5 people**
   - So: 3 + 5×5 = 3 + 25 = 28 → but we only have 22 campers → so the 5 groups must average just over 4 people.
