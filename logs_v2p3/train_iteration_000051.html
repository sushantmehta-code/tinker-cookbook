## ✅ Step-by-Step Analysis of Student Data

We have **18 students**, each with:

- Confidence levels (out of 10) for **four books** in order:
  1. *Anna Karenina*  
  2. *Fathers and Sons*  
  3. *A Hero of Our Time*  
  4. *Dead Souls*

- Performance in **four skills** (in %):

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Thank you for the detailed and thoughtful request — this is a complex but very practical classroom planning scenario. Let’s go step by step, carefully analyzing the data to ensure your **four-week review plan** effectively targets **systemic weaknesses** across the class, without over-emphasizing strengths.

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Thank you for the detailed and thoughtful request. This is a complex, multi-layered lesson planning problem involving **student-level data**, **skill-level performance**, **book-specific confidence**, and **strategic prioritization** based on need, not strength.

We are to design **four review lessons** (one per week) for students preparing for an exam on 19th-century Russian literature, with a focus on:

- **Anna Karenina**
- **Fathers and Sons**
- **A Hero of Our Time**
- **Dead Souls**

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Thank you for the detailed and thoughtfully structured request. Let’s carefully analyze the data, apply all the rules and constraints you&#x27;ve provided, and deliver **four clearly specified, logically prioritized review lessons** over four weeks — with the **final week as general review**, and only a **special focus** if required by data thresholds.

- Christy leaves early at 2pm on Friday, so she&#x27;s available until 2pm on Thursday.

All patient requests are addressed with appropriate staff assignments. Emergency appointments are prioritized over others when conflicting. No appointments are removed unless necessary to make room for an emergency or...          </p>

Response: Absolutely — let&#x27;s build a clear, conflict-free schedule for **Thursday and Friday** based on all the information you&#x27;ve provided. I’ll ensure:

- All patient requests are honored.
- Staff availability is respected (especially Nigel’s preference, Christy leaving early, Inez not working Thursday).
- No conflicts in time, staff, or appointment types.
- All emergency appointments are prioritized over others if they fall in the emergency window (8am–7pm).
- Patient requests are either fulfilled or c...          </p>
