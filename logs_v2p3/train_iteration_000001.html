Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

Clients are grouped based on their average monthly weight trends over at least 2 months of data. A client is categorized as &quot;Losing Weight&quot; if their average weight is decreasing over time (i.e., consistent downward trend over at least 2 months). If there is no clear downward trend or the weight remains stable or increases, they are categorized as &quot;No Improvement.&quot;

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

*Clients with less than 2 months of data are excluded.*

- **Losing Weight**: Clients who show a consistent downward trend in weight over at least 2 months (with a noticeable reduction in average monthly weight).
- **No Improvement**: Clients whose weight remains stable or increases over time, with no clear downward trend (after 2 months of data).

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

Clients with fewer than 2 months of data have been excluded.  
All remaining clients have at least 2 months of weight data.

- **Losing weight**: Clients who show a consistent downward trend in average monthly weight over at least 2 months (or a clear reduction over 2+ months).  
- **No improvement**: Clients whose weight has remained stable or increased over time, despite 2+ months of data.

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

Clients with less than 2 months of data are excluded.  
We evaluate each client&#x27;s average monthly weight over at least 2 months to determine if they are showing a downward trend (losing weight) or not.

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

Clients with less than 2 months of data are excluded.  
We analyze the average monthly weight over at least 2 months to determine trends.

- **Cassandra**: Data from months 7 to 10 (4 months). Average weight = (155 + 154 + 154.2 + 153) / 4 = **154.3 lbs** → Shows steady decline → **Losing weight**  
- **Michaela**: Data from months 3 to 10 (8 months). Average weight = (202.3+202+202+201.5+203+201+204+202)/8 = **202.4 lbs** → No c...          </p>

Response: **Section 1: Client Categorization**

Clients are grouped into one of two categories: *Losing weight* or *No improvement*, based on their average monthly weight trends. Any client with less than 2 months of data is excluded.

- **Losing weight**: Clients who show a consistent decrease in average monthly weight over time (i.e., a clear downward trend in their recorded weights).
- **No improvement**: Clients whose weight remains stable or increases over time, with no significant downward trend.

Response: **Section 1: Client Grouping (Losing Weight vs. No Improvement)**

Clients are grouped based on their average monthly weight trends over at least 2 months of data. A client is categorized as **losing weight** if their weight shows a consistent downward trend over at least two consecutive months (with a minimum of 2 months of data). If there is no clear trend toward weight loss, or if weight remains stable or increases, they are categorized as **no improvement**.
