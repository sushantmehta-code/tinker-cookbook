          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Great! Let&#x27;s create a balanced and realistic volunteer schedule that respects each person&#x27;s restrictions, maximizes trail coverage, keeps daily walking limits under 3 miles, and ensures no one drives to more than two parks per day. We’ll also avoid assigning anyone to walk more than one park on a day (where possible) to reduce driving and fatigue.
