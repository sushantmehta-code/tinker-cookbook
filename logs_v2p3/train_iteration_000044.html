Response: Absolutely — this is a fantastic idea for an extra credit question that deeply engages students in the real, messy, and nuanced art of medical diagnosis. Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is indeed notoriously hard to diagnose due to its subtle presentation, overlap with other conditions, and lack of definitive early biomarkers. By embedding clues in realistic, everyday clinical details — rather than overt hints or keyword associations — you push students to think like real clinicians, using context, hi...          </p>
