Response: Great question — you&#x27;re tackling a real-world scheduling puzzle with constraints, costs, and team dynamics. Let’s solve this **step-by-step**, ensuring:

✅ Every team plays every week (each team plays every other team once per league)  
✅ Games start at 8 a.m. on Saturdays  
✅ Games are 1 hour long  
✅ Set-up and clean-up take 30 minutes before and after (so each game block needs a 1.5-hour window)  
✅ Gym constraints:  
- Gym 1: Can host **2 games at once** (e.g., 2 pre-k/K or 2 1st/2nd) — **on...          </p>

The day will begin with a welcome and quiet circle in the covered seating area, where families can gather and share simple reflections on the term. From 10:15am, children will engage in a solo creative activity: writing a winter acrostic poem about nature, using a prompt like &quot;Snow, Stillness, Squirrel, Sun, Silence&quot;. An example poem is:  
*Snow — soft, silent, white and deep*  
*Stillness — the world holds its breath*  
*Squirrel — bold and busy, pr...          </p>

The day begins at 10am with a welcome circle in the covered seating area, where families gather to share warm drinks and a short winter-themed welcome. Kids and parents will then choose from parallel activities: a solo nature-based winter acrostic poem creation (using a worksheet with a sample poem) in the wooded area, and a quiet mud kitchen craft involving building a winter-themed dish (e.g. ‘seltzer snowballs’) in the mud kitchen.
